      <div class='line in6'>The Island lies nine leagues away.</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Along its solitary shore</div>
      <div class='line in6'>Of craggy rock and sandy bay,</div>
      <div class='line in8'>No sound but ocean’s roar,</div>

</div>

<p class='c009'>The scenes of our story lie along the Western shore
of Maryland, near the mouth of the Potomac River, and
among the islets of the Chesapeake Bay.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nothing can be more beautiful, grand, and inspiring
than the scenery of this region.</p>

<p class='c010'>The great Potomac, a mighty and invincible monarch
of rivers, even from her first stormy conquest, in which
she rent apart the everlasting mountains, and forced herself
a passage to the sea—widens and broadens her channel,
extending the area of her empire continually as she
goes on her irresistible way in a vast, calm, majestic flow
of waters to the ocean.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the mouth of the river on the north, or Maryland
side, is Point Lookout; on the south, or Virginia side, is
Smith’s Point, with an expanse of water twenty miles
in width between them.</p>

<p class='c010'>The shore on the Maryland side is broken by the most
beautiful creeks and inlets, and dotted by the most beautiful
islets that imagination can depict—creeks whose
crystal-clear waters reflect every undulating hill and
vale, every shadowy tree and bright flower lying upon
their banks, and every soft and dark, or sun-gilded and
glorious cloud floating in the skies above their bosoms;
islets whose dewy, fresh and green luxuriance of vegetation,
darksome trees and profound solitude, tempt one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>into poetic dreams of an ideal hermitage. The beauty
and interest of this shore is enhanced by the occasional
glimpses of rural homes—magnificent, or simply picturesque—seen
indistinctly through the trees, at the
head of some creek, on the summit of some distant hill,
or in the shades of some thick grove.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nothing can surpass the pleasure of the opposite but
delightfully blended emotions inspired by this scene.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the one hand the near shore, with its inlets and
islands, its sunny hills and shadowy dells, its old forests,
its cornfields, and its sweet, sequestered homes, yields
that dear sense of safety and repose which the most adventurous
never like to lose entirely.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the other hand, looking out to the sea, the broad
expanse of waters, the free and unobstructed pathway
to all parts of the world, fills and dilates the heart with
an exultant sense of boundless freedom!</p>

<p class='c010'>I said that the islets of the Potomac were fertile, verdant,
and luxurious in vegetation. This is because their
sandy soil is mixed freely with clay and marl; because
it is enriched with the deposits of the vast flocks of water-fowl
that hover upon them for safe repose; and finally,
because, unlike the worn-out lands of the peninsula, the
soil is a virgin one, where for ages vegetation has
budded, bloomed, and decayed, and returned to the
earth to fertilize it. (And here let me be pardoned for
saying that it is a matter of surprise to me that the attention
of enterprising men has never been turned to
these islands as a source of agricultural wealth; for, besides
the rich fertility of the soil, the salubrity of the air,
and the beauty and grandeur of the land and water
scenery, these islands are rich in shoals of fish, crabs,
and oysters, and in vast flocks of water-fowl. But we
ever overlook and leave the near to seek the far-off goal.)</p>

<p class='c010'>Beyond the mouth of the river, however, and up the
coast of the bay, the islands are sandy and poor—nearly
unproductive, or entirely barren.</p>

<p class='c010'>Anyone who will turn to the map of Maryland will
see that the Chesapeake Bay is interspersed with numerous
islands of all sizes, from the largest—Kent Island—to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>the smallest, nameless sand bank; that the eastern and
western shores of Maryland are beautifully diversified
with every modification of land and water scenery; that
the inlets and islands of the coast form the most charming
features of the landscape.</p>

<hr class='c011'>

<p class='c010'>Some distance above Point Lookout, at the mouth of
the Potomac River, up the western shore of Maryland,
there is a beautiful inlet, or small bay, making up about
three miles into the land, called St. Clara’s Bay by one
of the early Roman Catholic settlers. At the headwaters
of this inlet is a small, very old hamlet, the site of one
of the first settlements of the State, intended once, no
doubt, for a great colonial seaport, and christened by
the same sponsor St. Clarasville. With its fine harbor
and great commercial facilities, whatever could have arrested
its growth and withered it in its prime I do not
know—possibly the very abundance of other good harbors
on the coast—probably the frequent and violent
dissensions between the pre-emption freebooters of the
Bay Isles and the legal proprietors and settlers of the
mainland. Lying two miles off the mouth of this inlet,
and stretching across in front of it, is an oblong, sandy,
and nearly barren island—rich, however, in fish, crabs,
oysters, and water-fowl, and upon this account a great
resort in early colonial times, and baptized by the same
devout claimant of the bay and town St. Clara’s Isle, in
honor of his patron saint.</p>

<p class='c010'>But there was another claimant of the island, inlet, and
township; a freebooter, who, believing in and acknowledging
no greater personage than himself, had named
the isle, the bay, and town also, when it was laid out,
after himself. So they were first and most frequently
called Hutton’s Island, Bay, and Town.</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A proud, aristocratic hall it seems,</div>
      <div class='line'>Not courting, but discouraging approach.</div>
      <div class='line in32'><i>—Moultrie.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Let me introduce you to Mount Calm, the seat of
General Aaron Garnet. Even from the bay you can see
the mansion house, with its broad white front, as it
crowns the highest of a distant range of hills. After passing
through the village of Hutton, and going up and
down the grassy hills that rise one above the other beyond
it, you enter a deep hollow, thickly grown with
woods, and passing through it, begin to ascend by a
heavily shaded forest road, the last and highest hill of
the range—Mount Calm. When about halfway up this
hill you come to the brick walls inclosing the private
grounds, and passing through the porter’s gate you
enter a heavily-shaded carriage drive, that, sweeping
around in an ascending half-circle, brings you up before
the mansion house.</p>

<p class='c010'>Behind the house was a green slope and a thick grove
that concealed from view the extensive outbuildings connected
with the establishment. Extensive fields of corn,
wheat, rye, oats, tobacco, etc., spread all over the undulatory
land. The estate itself comprised several thousands
of the best acres in old St. Mary’s County, and there
were several hundred of them under the best cultivation
and in the richest state of productiveness.</p>

<p class='c010'>This princely estate had remained in the possession of
the Chesters since the first settlement of the county, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>unlike the usual fate of old Maryland plantations, the
property had not only been carefully preserved, but had
steadily increased in value up to the time of the Revolution,
when it had reached its highest importance.</p>

<p class='c010'>The estate was then in the hands of Charles Chester,
Esq., Justice of the Peace and Associate Judge of the
Provincial Court. His family consisted of a wife, two
sons, and a daughter.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the breaking out of the Revolution Judge Chester
and his two stalwart boys took the field among the first,
and at the triumphant close of the war Colonel Chester
set out on his return home with a pair of epaulettes,
minus his pair of goodly sons, who were left not only
dead upon the field of glory, but buried with all the
honors of victorious war upon the immortal plains of
Yorktown. And thus it happened that the heirship of the
heavy estate, with all its burden of onerous responsibilities,
fell upon the frail shoulders of young Alice Chester—a
fair-skinned, golden-haired, blue-eyed girl of seventeen,
the fairest, gentlest, and most fragile being that ever
owed life to a stern and warlike sire. Alice, living at
home with her simple-hearted, domestic mother, had
been very little noticed by her father, or even by anyone
else, until, by the death of his sons, she became the sole
heiress of the vast estate, which was to prove the greatest
misfortune of her life.</p>

<p class='c010'>The long, long bleak winters were passed in almost
inviolable seclusion, cheered only by an occasional letter
from the army, and an occasional ride to church, if the
road happened to be passable, which was seldom the case.</p>

<p class='c010'>This life lasted until Alice was fifteen years of age,
when an event occurred such as would make no stir at
all in a city, but which will throw a quiet country neighborhood
into convulsions, namely, a change of ministry—not
national, but parochial! The old parson, compelled
by declining health, had departed to take charge of a
congregation farther south, and a young parson had
come in his stead. The Rev. Milton Sinclair was handsome,
graceful, and accomplished.</p>

<p class='c010'>By the invitation of Mrs. Chester the young minister
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>became the temporary inmate of Mount Calm, and very
much he entertained and instructed, cheered and sustained
the secluded mother and daughter. He became
the almoner of the lady to the poor around. He directed
and superintended the reading of Alice; introducing
gradually, as her opening mind could bear, all
the beauties and glories of science, history, philosophy,
and poetry.</p>

<p class='c010'>As the days fled, Alice and Milton Sinclair grew to
love each other, and one day the minister told his great
love and was made happy by Alice confessing that she
returned his affection. Mrs. Chester, too, approved of
the match, and she set her maids to work carding, spinning,
knitting, weaving, and sewing, that Alice might
have a full supply of every description of household
cloth and linen. The bride’s trousseau was the last
thing thought of, and there was time enough, she
thought, for that when her father should arrive. She did
not know when that would be, but it was well to have
everything that took a great deal of time and labor, such
as the house and furniture and the household stuff, ready—as
for the wedding dresses and other minor preparations,
of course they must be deferred until Colonel
Chester’s arrival, and then they could be speedily got up.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was in the midst of this domestic happiness, this
great tense joy and hope, that the thunderbolt fell!</p>

      <div class='line in38'><i>—Shakspere.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>First came the news of the glorious victory of Yorktown—the
final and signal triumph of the American
arms. There were no railroads and telegraphic wires in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>those days, and very few newspapers. The report, the
re-echo of this splendid victory, rolled on toward their
quiet neighborhood like a storm; in clouds of doubt, in
thunder and lightning of astonishment, joy, and mad triumph.
The most delirious rejoicing convulsed the whole
village and neighborhood for days, before any newspaper
arrived with an account of the battle.</p>

<p class='c010'>And the same mail that brought the newspaper,
with a long account of the battle, headed in great capital
letters line below line, brought also a letter sealed
with black that sped like a bullet through the foreboding
heart of Mrs. Chester, a letter from Colonel Chester, announcing
the glorious death of his two brave sons upon
the field of victory.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Chester was overwhelmed with grief by the twofold
bereavement, the fall of both her gallant sons, of
whom she was as proud as fond.</p>

<p class='c010'>She did not dream of the calamity, worse than death,
that had befallen Alice, in the disguise of a princely inheritance,
destined to darken her whole life with sorrow,
while it mocked her in the face of the world with
its unreal light and splendor.</p>

<p class='c010'>But there was one who was not so forgetful—Colonel
Chester. He was still with the army, but another letter
was received from him, announcing his speedy return
home, accompanied by his friend and companion in
arms, General Garnet, a young officer, who, though but
thirty years of age, had risen to the highest rank in the
army, and won an immortal fame.</p>

<p class='c010'>Colonel Chester came at length, accompanied by General
Garnet. He met Alice with great empressement—for
it was scarcely great affection—praised her growth
and her beauty, introduced General Garnet, and, excusing
himself for a few moments, passed to the sick-chamber
of his wife.</p>

<p class='c010'>Left alone with her guest Alice examined him shyly,
with the curiosity of a woman and the bashfulness of a
country girl. General Garnet was what young ladies call
a fine, military-looking man. He certainly had a fine,
martial figure and bearing, or that which is our ideal of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>it—a tall and elegantly proportioned figure, a calm,
majestic carriage, yet withal suggestive of great reposing
strength and fire. His voice was perfect harmony
itself. His manner was dignified and imposing, or graceful,
earnest, and seductive. Yet, sometimes, one in a sudden,
vague astonishment, would feel that he was a man
who could unite the utmost inflexibility, and even cruelty
of purpose, with the most graceful and gracious urbanity
of manner. With all his marvelous powers of fascination
he was a man to darken, chill, repel a bright-spirited,
warm-souled, pure-hearted girl like Alice. Yet
she did the honors of her father’s house to her father’s
guest until that guest merged into the lover, and then
Alice felt and betrayed the utmost soul-sickened repugnance
to him and his suit.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was now that the object of Colonel Chester in inviting
this distinguished visitor to Mount Calm became
evident—that of bestowing the hand of his daughter and
heiress upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>After a conversation with General Garnet he sent for
Alice, and, without any preface at all, bade her make
up her mind to a speedy marriage with the husband he
had chosen for her, his distinguished and dear friend,
General Garnet.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alice passed from the room, mechanically pressing her
hands to her temples, trying to awake as from a heart-sickening
dream. And so she passed to her now frequent
post of duty, her declining mother’s darkened
room and sick-bed. The senses, or the intuitions, or the
instincts of those on the confines of the unseen world are
sometimes preternaturally acute. There was that in the
falling footstep, in the very form and bearing, of Alice, as
she glided through the shadows of that dark room, that
revealed to the mother the existence of some heavy cloud
teeming with sorrow, that was ready to burst upon the
devoted head of her child.</p>

<p class='c010'>She called Alice to her bedside, took her hand in her
gentle grasp, looked with wondering sadness into her
eyes—her eyes set in the stare of blank stupor—and murmured
tenderly:</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>“What is the matter, Alice? Tell your mother?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Her mother’s loving voice and touch unsealed the
spellbound founts of tears and speech.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, mother! mother! I am ruined! ruined!” she
wildly gasped, and, sinking down upon the floor,
dropped her head upon the bed with hysterical sobs and
gasps, and inarticulate wailings.</p>

<p class='c010'>Her mother laid her gentle hand upon her child’s
burning and throbbing head, and raised her tender eyes
in silent prayer for her, while this storm raged, and until
it passed, and Alice, exhausted, but calm, was able to
rise, sit by her side, and while she held her hand, tell her
what had happened.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will speak to him, Alice,” she then said. “I will
tell him how you and Sinclair love each other—as you
could not tell him, my child. I will show him how vain—oh,
how vain! are wealth, and rank, and honor, and
glory, in the hour of grief, by the bed of death, in the
presence of God! how love, and truth, and faith are all
in all! Yes! and I will make him feel it, too. And,
though he should not realize it as I do, yet he will never
refuse me a request now!”</p>

<p class='c010'>And the next morning, directly after breakfast, Colonel
Chester received a message from his wife, requesting
him to come to her room for a few minutes, if convenient,
as she wished to speak with him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Colonel Chester went. What passed at that interview
no one knew more than what might be guessed from
what followed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Colonel Chester came out of the room, banging the
door after him, with a half-uttered imprecation upon
“sickly fancies,” “irritable nerves,” and “foolish
women.” But immediately after this interview Mrs.
Chester became much worse; her fever rose to delirium,
and she was alarmingly ill for several days. Milton Sinclair
heard of her state, and, little suspecting the cause,
came to see her. He was met by Colonel Chester, who
informed him that his wife was too ill to receive even
her pastor, and requested him to walk into the library.
There Colonel Chester informed him that circumstances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>had occurred which made it his painful duty to beg that
Mr. Sinclair would temporarily suspend his visits to
Mount Calm.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Alice!” exclaimed the young man. That name contained
everything, and rendered a full explanation indispensable.
It was given.</p>

<p class='c010'>Deadly pale, Sinclair walked up and down the floor,
pressing his head tightly between his two palms and
groaning—groaning the name, the prayer, that in the
bitterest agony of the soul starts to every lip:</p>

<p class='c010'>“My God! oh, my God! have pity on me! God have
mercy on me!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The heart-broken tone of these words touched even
that hard man of the world, Colonel Chester.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come, come, Sinclair; you must have been prepared
for this for some months past. I did not violently and
at once separate you from Alice when I first came home,
although you must have known that all our plans were
changed. I gave you time to wean yourself gradually
off. In other circumstances, indeed, I should have felt
myself most honored, most happy in the alliance; but we
do not control our own destinies. Good-day, Sinclair.
You will forget Alice.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Sinclair! Sinclair! Where in the world was he?
Where had he been so many days? Why did he not
come? Alice could have given the world to have seen
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>She did not know that he had been forbidden the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>house. She was totally ignorant of everything that had
passed between her father and himself. She walked
wildly about the house and grounds, instinctively avoiding
her feeble mother’s room, lest in her present distracted
state she should kill her with agitation; afraid of
meeting her father, and doubly afraid of encountering
General Garnet, and wishing and praying—oh! praying,
as if for dear life, that she might meet Sinclair.</p>

<p class='c010'>One afternoon she wrote a wild letter to him, illegible
and unintelligible every way except in this—that he
must “come to Mount Calm immediately.” She sent
the letter off, and walked up and down her chamber, trying
to get calm enough to go and see her mother. While
thus employed a message reached her from her mother,
desiring her to come to her room. Alice went immediately.
As she entered the dark chamber Mrs. Chester
called her up to the side of her bed; she saw that her
mother’s countenance had changed fearfully since the
morning, and now a new terror and remorse seized her
heart; she was about to speak, when Mrs. Chester said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Alice, you look frightfully pale and haggard, my
dear child. Alice, we were foiled this morning. Your
father has been here, and told me all about it—the projected
marriage in a week, and all; but do not fear, my
dear child, you shall not be sacrificed; it is not right. I
have sent a message to Mr. Sinclair to come here this
evening. He has not been here for some time, and when
he comes I must have a talk with him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>At this moment a servant entered the chamber, to
whom Mrs. Chester turned, saying:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Milly, mix a teaspoonful of ether with a little water,
and hand it to Miss Alice. She is not well. You must
take it, Alice, dear; you are really very ill, and it will
compose your nerves.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Sinclair is downstairs, madam, and wants to
know if he may come up,” said the girl, as she handed
the glass to Alice.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alice dropped the glass, untasted.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where is General Garnet?” said Mrs. Chester.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the library, writing, madam.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>“Where is Colonel Chester?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gone out riding, madam.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank Heaven! Yes, request Mr. Sinclair to come
up, Milly.”</p>

<p class='c010'>After the departure of the girl the mother and daughter
remained in silent expectation. At last the light,
quick footstep of Sinclair was heard upon the stairs.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Go and meet him, Alice, my darling,” said the
mother, with a smile.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alice arose, and as he opened the door and advanced
into the room, started forward and threw herself weeping
into his arms. What could he do but press her to his
bosom? Then he led her back to her mother’s bedside—stooped
over the sick lady, taking her hand, and inquiring
tenderly, respectfully, after her health of body and
soul. While she was making her gentle, patient reply,
the attention of all three was arrested by the noise of
heavy, hurried footsteps hastening up the stairs.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is your father, Alice! Oh, God, save us!” exclaimed
Mrs. Chester, just as Colonel Chester, with one
violent kick of his boot, burst open the door, and, purple
and convulsed with rage, stood among them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who admitted this man? Who sent for him?” he
demanded, in a furious voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I did. I sent for him,” said the mother, pale with
fear and feebleness, but wishing to shield her daughter.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I did! I wrote him a note,” murmured the daughter,
in a dying voice, sick with terror, but wishing to save her
mother.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Traitors! Shameless household traitors! so there are
a pair of you! a desirable wife and daughter! a very
suitable mother and daughter! But I’ll find a way to
punish you both. I’ll——”</p>

<p class='c010'>Here he was interrupted by Sinclair, who, turning to
him, said, in a composed but stern voice:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Colonel Chester, visit your anger and reproaches
upon me, who knew of your prohibition, not upon those
who possibly knew nothing about it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have the insolence to tell me, sir, to remind me,
that you knew of my prohibition to cross my threshold!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>while standing here in my house, in the very heart of
my house, my wife’s bedchamber!” exclaimed Colonel
Chester furiously.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In your wife’s sick-chamber, sir, where, as a Christian
minister, it is my bounden duty sometimes to come.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And, d—— you, from whence I’ll put you out!”
exclaimed the infuriated man.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will go. Good-evening, Mrs. Chester; good-evening,
Alice. I leave you in the care of Heaven,” said
Sinclair, wishing, by all means, to avoid the disgrace of
a struggle.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Go! what, go quietly like an honored guest dismissed?
No, d—— you, you came surreptitiously, and
you shall depart involuntarily. No, d—— you, I will
put you out!” vociferated the maniac, in an ungovernable
fury, springing upon Sinclair.</p>

<p class='c010'>A violent struggle ensued. Sinclair acted entirely
upon the defensive, saying, continually, as he could
make himself heard:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Colonel Chester, let me go! I will leave quietly; I
would have done so at first.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And now the deathly grip and struggle went on in
silence, interrupted only by the short, curt, hissing exclamations
of the enraged man through his now whitened
lip and clenched teeth. Sinclair was half the age
and double the weight and strength of his opponent, and
could easily have mastered him, but did not want the
odium of doing it.</p>

<p class='c010'>While wrestling desperately on the defensive, he expostulated
once more:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Colonel Chester—not for my sake, but for your own—for
your family’s, for honor’s sake, let me depart in
peace!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah, villain!” exclaimed the madman, finding his
strength failing, and suddenly drawing a pistol, he
pointed it at Sinclair’s temple and fired. Sinclair suddenly
started, and the bullet went through the window,
shattering the glass. Chester now raised the spent pistol
and aimed with it a violent blow upon Sinclair’s head.
Sinclair quickly caught his descending hand, when——</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>A power more awful than the judge’s baton, the monarch’s
scepter, or the priest’s elevated crucifix arrested
the combat.</p>

<p class='c010'>Death stood in their presence! A cry of mortal anguish
from Alice caused both to turn and look—both to
drop their hold—and stand like conscience-stricken
culprits!</p>

<p class='c010'>There lay Mrs. Chester, the gentle, patient, long-suffering
woman, stricken down, dying in her daughter’s
arms.</p>

<p class='c010'>Colonel Chester came to his senses at once, feeling all
the horror and remorse of a murderer.</p>

<p class='c010'>And Sinclair repented from his soul that he had not
permitted himself to be expelled from the house with
every species of ignominy rather than to have seen this.</p>

<p class='c010'>That ashen brow—those fixed eyes—that silent tongue,
and quick, gasping breath! that face of the dying! it
would never depart from his memory. Oh! any personal
indignity rather than this memory! if he could but save
her! but she was beyond all help now, for—even as full
of sorrow and remorse he gazed—with a long, deep sigh,
as for the pilgrims she left behind on earth, her spirit
passed to God.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sinclair bore Alice, fainting, from the room.</p>

<p class='c010'>Colonel Chester fell down on his knees, dropping his
head upon the bed, and throwing his arms over his dead
wife in a paroxysm of remorse and despair, ungovernable
as his rage had been, and, alas! nearly as transient!</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>After this terrible family storm, in which poor Mrs.
Chester’s vital powers had suddenly failed, the peace
stern death enforces reigned through the house. Alice,
her heart and brain overturned by endurance, lay exhausted,
almost insensible, upon her bed within her
chamber.</p>

<p class='c010'>General Garnet had taken himself off to the village
tavern, whence he had been invited to pass a week or
two, at Point Yocomoco, the seat of Judge Wylie.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Sinclair, in the disinterested kindness of his heart,
remained at the house, superintending and directing
everything, unquestioned by Colonel Chester, who, when
he met, recognized him with a sigh or a groan. He remained
until the funeral was over, and the house restored
to its former order, and departed without seeing
Alice, who, still prostrated, had not left her room. And
after this, as Colonel Chester had not revoked his prohibition,
he came to the house no more.</p>

<p class='c010'>As days glided into weeks Alice recovered a portion of
her strength, left the chamber, and mournfully went
about her customary occupations.</p>

<p class='c010'>Poor Alice! her spirit was very willing, but her nerves
were very weak. So it was with a pang of fear that
Alice heard her father at the breakfast table one morning
announce the expected arrival of General Garnet
that evening. Yes, Colonel Chester, thinking that now
perhaps sufficient time had elapsed since her mother’s
death—and sufficient strength and cheerfulness had returned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>to his daughter—had recalled her suitor. Alice
was trembling violently—she dared not look up. She
had been taught to love and venerate her father above all
earthly beings, and next to God. She loved and venerated
him still, and kept her thoughts reverently away
from investigating his motive and judging his conduct.
She had been taught to bow with implicit and reverential
obedience to his will. To oppose him had not been easy
in her thought—it was terrible in practice. It would
have been terrible to her had her father been a man of
moderate temper and self-control; but he was a man of
violent and ungovernable passion; and Alice was in an
agony of terror when she faltered out:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Father, if General Garnet comes here only as your
guest, I will welcome him with every possible attention;
I will try to make him feel at home, and endeavor to
render his sojourn with us in every other way agreeable;
but if he comes here as my suitor——” Here her voice
died away.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well!”</p>

<p class='c010'>It is impossible to convey the short, curt, galvanic
strength and abruptness with which he jerked, as it
were, this syllable out, and brought Alice up. It was like
throwing the lasso suddenly around her neck, and jerking
her up face to face with him. And such a face! It
is impossible to paint the grim determination of the
locked jaws, armed with the wiry stubble beard, bristled
up with fierceness, and the ferocity of the darkly-gathered
frown that screwed his glance upon her pallid
face, that screwed it into her very brain. Alice turned
deadly sick, her eyes filmed over, and she sank back in
her chair. She did not faint or lose consciousness, for
the next instant she felt her father’s iron hand upon her
fragile shoulder, and her father’s awful voice in that low,
deep, suppressed tone of fierce, immutable determination,
saying:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Miss Chester, it is not as your suitor, but as your
husband, that General Garnet will come this evening. I
command you to receive him as such.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And he left her.</p>

      <div class='line in40'><i>—Coleridge.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Let us hasten over the next few hideous weeks.
Alice had a serious illness, from which she recovered
slowly; her spirit utterly broken; her heart utterly
crushed; her very brain clouded. Her whole being
bowed down by the storm of sorrow, yet with no one to
support, comfort, sympathize with her. Sinclair, that
only living being who could have saved her, was absent,
forbidden to approach her. She was left alone, almost
imbecile, and so quite defenseless in the terrible power
of her father.</p>

<p class='c010'>And what words are these to write! and what a position
was hers when that divinely appointed parental authority—that
protective and beneficent power—was perverted
by pride, ambition, and selfishness into an engine
of mighty torture, inflicting a fatal and life long calamity!</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet the father verily believed that he was disinterestedly
serving his daughter’s best interests. There is
no more profoundly mournful illustration of the ruined
archangel than that of any perverted love.</p>

<p class='c010'>With the support of her feeble mother, had she lived—with
the support of Sinclair, had his piety been less
æscetic, more hopeful—Alice might have successfully resisted
the fate impending over her; but she was alone,
reduced by sorrow and illness to a state of imbecility of
mind and body, and she succumbed to her destiny.</p>

<p class='c010'>So, in just three months from the death of her mother
Alice Chester, pallid, cold, nearly lifeless, whiter than the
pearls in her pale hair, stood in bridal array before God’s
holy altar, to vow in the hearing of men and angels to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>love and honor one whom she found it difficult not to
hate and despise.</p>

<p class='c010'>Immediately after the marriage they set out upon a
bridal tour through the North. They were absent all
summer. Early in autumn they returned to Mount
Calm, where, at the earnest desire of Colonel Chester,
they took up their residence. Alice would have preferred
it otherwise.</p>

<p class='c010'>After their marriage, and during their long and varied
bridal tour, she had, as it were, lost her identity, seeming
to herself to be someone else. The varied scenes of her
journey—the stage-offices, turnpike roads, country taverns,
great cities with their masses of brick and mortar,
public edifices, forests of shipping, gay shops, theaters,
concerts, balls, illuminations, dancings, splendid attire,
stage pageantry, the ranting and the after silence, land
journeys, water journeys—all haunted by one painful
presence—had passed before her like a phantasmagoria;
like a continuation of her brain fever, with its nervous
delirium and grotesque or hideous visions and hallucinations.
So all had seemed to her, while she seemed to all
a pale, pretty, silent girl.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is a point of suffering beyond which sorrow destroys
itself—is not felt as real—just as there is a crisis
at which physical agony superinduces insensibility. So
it had been with Alice, until she re-entered her native
State, and memory and association were at work again,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>“And the accustomed train</div>
      <div class='line'>Of things grew round her brain again”;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>then it was with the shrinking dread with which a
burned child would approach fire that Alice drew near
her home. She would have preferred to remain away
for ever, amid the kaleidoscopic changes of her new,
wandering, unreal life, rather than have awakened from
the strange, painful, but very vague dream; rather than
have consciousness forced upon her by the dear, old familiar
scenes and associations of her home—her once
peaceful, hopeful, happy home, as by</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>

</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>The day of their arrival at home a large company had
been invited to meet them at dinner. The days that followed
were filled up with dinner parties. At length,
late in the fall, they were quietly settled, and the monotonous
routine of daily country life commenced. One
thing Alice dreaded and avoided—appearing at church
again under her new position and name. But Sinclair
had accepted a “call” to a church in the West, which
opened to him a new field of labor and usefulness. His
departure followed; and this was a great relief to Alice,
who, with the “sigh of a great deliverance, tried to leave
the past with all its gloom and terror,” and turn to the
future with some hope.</p>

<p class='c010'>Two events of great domestic importance occurred in
the second year of their marriage; one was the death of
Colonel Chester, who died, as all their neighbors said,
of nothing more than his diabolical temper; as their
physician said, of congestion of the brain, brought on by
excitement. And what do you think was the cause of
this fatal excitement? That the child of Alice happened
to be a girl instead of a boy, which he had set his heart
upon.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>Alice was almost in solitary confinement in the cold,
stern prison of her home, for General Garnet discouraged
association with old friends, who at least suggested
the past, if they did not openly refer to it.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>But there was one family, and that family the very
warmest and most steadfast among the few friends of
Sinclair, from whom General Garnet had not the will to
separate his young wife—the Wylies of Yocomoco, or
Point Pleasant, as their seat was more frequently called
by their delighted visitors. Who, indeed, had the will
or the power to do aught to annoy the delightful host
of Point Pleasant?</p>

<p class='c010'>Who in all the South has not heard of Judge Jacky
Wylie, still called judge because he had once sat upon
the bench, though not finding the seat comfortable, he
had abandoned it, affirming that he had “not the heart”
for the business? That was a favorite phrase of the
judge, who was always asserting that he “hadn’t the
heart,” when everyone knew that he had the largest
heart in all old Maryland.</p>

<p class='c010'>And there was his mother, a gentlewoman of the old
school, without any state about her, a Lady Bountiful of
the neighborhood, without any pretensions.</p>

<p class='c010'>Who did not know and love old Mrs. Wylie?</p>

<p class='c010'>How she was adored by the large, miscellaneous family
Jack had gathered together! To be sure, all Jacky’s
unprovided nieces and nephews were her grandchildren,
and it was partly for love of her, to please her, to let
her gather all her second brood under her wing, that her
son Jacky collected them. Yes, she was adored by all
that household of laughing girls and roystering boys,
the tide of whose love and fondness for her was so great
that it sometimes overflowed the barriers of veneration—just
as Jacky’s confidence in God sometimes swamped
his reverence!—but most of all was she idolized by the
adopted son of Judge Jacky, Ulysses Roebuck.</p>

<p class='c010'>Next to his grandmother Ulysses loved his smallest
cousin, little Ambrosia, the only child of Judge Jacky,
and the little goddess of the whole household of
grown-up and growing young men and maidens. Little
Ambrosia, named after her Uncle Ambrose, who had
been the elder and only brother of Jacky, and the favorite
of his mother, but who had died in youth. And
it was to please his mother that Jacky, having no son,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>called his little daughter after his brother. And it was
a lovely name, too, he thought—a lovely, tempting, caressable
name! really better than one could have hoped;
for Ambrose was old-fashioned and ugly—low be it
spoken.</p>

<p class='c010'>I think the negroes must have conceived it to be a
“tempting” name, too; for, with their inevitable fault of
corrupting language, they called the little seraph, with
her charming face and sunny hair, “Miss Ambush.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And “Marse Useless” and “Miss Ambush” were the
prime favorites of the plantation, notwithstanding, or
perhaps, because of, the dare-devil, don’t care-ishness of
the former.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was with this family, then, that General and Mrs.
Garnet interchanged frequent visits. Often the old lady,
Mrs. Wylie, accompanied by little Ambrosia and a waiting-maid,
would drive up to Mount Calm in their old-fashioned
phaeton, to spend the day; or else two or three
of the girls and young men would ride up to pass an
evening, and return by starlight. And not unfrequently
young Mrs. Garnet would go down with her little Alice
and pass a day and night at Point Pleasant.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was yet another family with whom the Garnets
were upon terms of close intimacy and friendship—their
next neighbors, the Hardcastles of Hemlock Hollow,
whose estate joined Mount Calm, lying immediately behind
and below it, and extending further inland. The
family at the Hollow consisted of Lionel Hardcastle,
High Sheriff of the State; his only son, Lionel, Jr., a
youth of fifteen, and his nephew, Magnus, a boy of ten
years old.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lionel Hardcastle was the only man in the county
with whom General Garnet could be said to be on terms
of close intimacy. Their estates, as I said, joined; their
rank in life was upon a par, and their country interests
almost identical. They were also of the same party in
politics, of the same denomination in religion, and of
like opinion upon all common and local questions; so
that there was very little to differ about, while there was
a great deal to attract them to each other in their very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>opposite temperaments and characters, experiences, and
mental acquisitions.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Garnet had always been strongly attached to the
family at the Hollow, and though there was no lady at
the head of the establishment to receive her, she continued
to accept the invitations to dinner extended to
General Garnet and herself, and always accompanied
him thither.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Mrs. Garnet had her favorite among the Hardcastles—this
was young Magnus Hardcastle, the nephew,
a fine, handsome, spirited, and generous boy, devotedly
fond of his beautiful neighbor, and her sweet little girl.
Very often would Mrs. Garnet take Magnus home with
her to spend several days or weeks at Mount Calm. And
when he was not staying there, still every day would
the boy find his way to Mount Calm, with some little
childish love-offering to its sweet mistress. In spring it
would be a bunch of wood violets, or wild sweet-briar
roses, gathered in the thicket, and of which Alice was
very fond; in summer, a little flag-basket of wild strawberries
or raspberries, which Alice loved better than hothouse
or garden fruit; in autumn, a hat full of chestnuts
and chinkapins, gathered in the forest, and hulled by
himself; even in winter the little fellow might be seen
trudging on, knee-deep in snow, with a bunch of snow-birds
which he had caught in his trap for pretty Cousin
Alice, as he called Mrs. Garnet.</p>

<p class='c010'>Very bright would grow Mrs. Garnet’s pleasant chamber
when Magnus, with his sunny smile, would break in
upon the pensive lady and the little child, and light up
all the room with his gladness. Very often the lady
would open her arms to receive the joyous boy, and fold
him to her bosom in a most loving clasp, grateful for
the new life and joy he ever brought her.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Garnet loved her own beautiful and gentle child,
but it was with a profound, earnest, almost mournful
and foreboding love.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Magnus was a perpetual day-spring of gladness
and delight to her. She could not look upon the boy
without a thrill of sympathetic joy and hope.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>And so the years had passed, and Alice grew happy
in their flight, until the second trial of her life approached.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

</div>

<p class='c009'>The Huttons, proprietors by pre-emption right of St.
Clara’s town, bay, and isle for more than two hundred
years, had settled among the islets of the bay many
years previous to the date of that patent by which
James I. granted the province of Maryland to George
Calvert.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the commencement of the American Revolution a
certain Captain Hugh Hutton, the then representative
and head of the family, fired with an enthusiastic passion
for liberty, or—fighting! sold a great portion of his patrimony,
and purchased, fitted out, and manned a privateer,
and sailed against the British flag.</p>

<p class='c010'>He served gallantly and with various success during
the whole period of the war.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the glorious close of the revolutionary struggle,
ruined in fortune and riddled with wounds, Captain
Hugh Hutton, the sailor-patriot and martyr, retired to
the last foothold of his once kingly estate, to the little
island of St. Clara’s, otherwise called Hutton’s Island—there
to die in obscurity.</p>

<p class='c010'>A few days previous to his death he called his only
son, Hugh, to his bedside, and enjoined him never to
demand—never even to accept compensation from Congress
for his services and his losses during the war.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My fortune, my labor, my life-blood were not sold,
but given to the cause of liberty and of my country,” he
said, and these were the last words of the sailor-patriot.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Hugh Hutton, the son, and now the sole representative
of the family, was at this time about eighteen years
old. Having lost his mother at an early age he had
been taken by his father as a companion in all his sea
voyages.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had sailed with him in his first privateering expedition
against the British ships. At first as a childish
and innocent spectator, afterward as a youthful and enthusiastic
actor, he had figured in all the sea-fights in
which his father’s ships had been engaged during the
whole course of the war.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus all education, except that exclusively of the sailor
and soldier, had been denied him. And thus Hugh Hutton,
though tall, strong, handsome, and gallant, like all
his race, was yet rude, unschooled, and unpolished.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was faithful to the dying injunctions of his father.
With many claims upon his country’s remembrance and
gratitude he set forth none.</p>

<p class='c010'>Loving the ocean with the passionate enthusiasm of all
his father’s nature, he took to it as his natural element.</p>

<p class='c010'>First he engaged in the humble capacity of mate on
board the <i>Little Agnes</i>, a small schooner plying between
Hutton Town and Baltimore or Alexandria, as the
freight or market demanded.</p>

<p class='c010'>After serving many years in this situation, an unexpected
turn in the wheel of fortune gave him the means
of purchasing a larger vessel of his own, and of extending
the area of his trade and the length of his voyages.
This was the death of the old ship-owner and captain
with whom he had sailed for many years, and who,
dying, left him all his moderate possessions on condition
of his marrying his only daughter, then a mere child
of fifteen years of age, and constituted him her guardian
until the marriage. The heart of the brave young sailor
had seldom or never turned on love or marriage—it was
not the nature of his free, wild, adventurous race. But
when he had buried his old captain in Baltimore, where
he died, and taken the command of the little schooner
to return home to Hutton Town to find his little ward
and wife—then—ah! then all sorts of strange, sweet, solemn,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>and tender thoughts of beauty, and love, and
home, and repose swarmed about his heart.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was late in the afternoon of a glorious October day
that the schooner, with her crew, put into the harbor
of Hutton’s Inlet. In striking contrast to the warm-hued,
deep-toned, refulgent natural scenery was the cold,
white front of a mansion house standing upon a distant
hill against the western horizon, and girt around with its
old ancestral trees. This was Mount Calm, the seat of
General Aaron Garnet.</p>

<p class='c010'>The little schooner, with its white sail, glided swiftly
and smoothly into the inlet, and cast anchor near the
hamlet. Leaving the vessel in charge of the mate, Captain
Hutton took a boat and went on shore. A crowd of
villagers, as usual, thronged the beach, anxious to hear
and to tell the news, and hearty greetings and noisy
questions met him as he stepped upon the strand, such
questions as:</p>

<p class='c010'>“How is the old captain? How is old Seabright?
Why don’t he come ashore?—though there is evil news
enough to meet him when he does come! Where is the
jolly old dog, then? I guess he’s wanting up at home
there?” were some of the storm of words hailed upon
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Friends,” replied the young sailor, shaking hands
right and left as he pushed on, “our old captain is outward
bound to that distant seaport whence no voyager
ever returns. Permit me now to go on and break the
sad news to his child.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Stay! Poor old man, when did he die? What ailed
him?” exclaimed two or three of the most persevering,
detaining him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“To-night, friends—to-night at the ‘Neptune and
Pan,’ I will tell you all about it. Permit me now to
pass on and take his last letter to his daughter,” said the
skipper good-humoredly, elbowing and pushing his
way through the crowd.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Stop! What’s to become of the young girl—pretty
Agnes Seabright? How did he leave his bit of property?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>“To-night, comrades—to-night, at the ‘Neptune and
Pan,’ I will meet you. You shall have a supper, and
drink to the memory of the outward-bound while I tell
you all about it. I must go now!” impatiently exclaimed
the captain, shaking off the pertinacious, and hastening
away up the straggling street of the hamlet.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hugh Hutton, like all his fathers, was far above the
usual height of men—indeed, all his characteristics were
not only marked, but extravagant; thus he was very
tall, broad-shouldered and deep-chested, very muscular
and thin, with a very dark complexion, with black hair
and eyes, and very high, commanding features. Honest,
brave, and frank even to rashness, generous even to
extravagance, unselfish to the degree that the worldly-wise
would call fatuity; yet he had never known a
mother’s care, a sister’s companionship, and his indifference
to home joys was as profound as his ignorance
of love and of woman. Brought up on a ship’s deck by
a rough sailor father, he learned to love the ocean and
wild liberty with a profound and passionate enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c010'>But now he had a little girl left to him. He must
make a home for her, take care of her, and make her
happy if he could. This was a very novel duty indeed,
and set him very keenly to thinking. The first natural,
strange, sweet fancies that had been awakened by the
idea of this lovely living legacy had fallen asleep again,
and left him to his normal, free, glad, but hard, unloving
nature. And now the thought of pretty Agnes Seabright
fretted him like a fetter.</p>

<p class='c010'>He pursued his walk up through the village, up over
the hills rising one beyond the other, until he came to
the arm of the forest stretching around the base of that
tallest distant hill, upon which stood the white-fronted
mansion house of Mount Calm. He pursued his walk
on through this arm of the forest, ascending the hill
until he came to a small cleared space, in which was a
little cot inclosed within a narrow garden and nearly
hidden with trees. He opened the small gate and passed
up the narrow walk between rows of marigolds, crimson,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>white, and yellow chrysanthemums, scarlet verbena
and other bright fall flowers, to the little door at which
he rapped.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER VIII.<br> <span class='large'>THE BRIDE OF THE ISLES.</span></h2>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A beautiful and happy girl,</div>
      <div class='line'>With step as soft as summer air,</div>
      <div class='line'>And fresh young lips and brow of pearl</div>
      <div class='line'>Shadowed by many a careless curl</div>
      <div class='line'>Of unconfined and flowing hair;</div>
      <div class='line'>A seeming child in everything,</div>
      <div class='line'>Save thoughtful brow and ripening charms,</div>
      <div class='line'>As nature wears the smile of spring,</div>
      <div class='line'>When sinking into summer’s arms.</div>
      <div class='line in32'><i>—Whittier.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The door was opened by a beautiful girl between
fourteen and fifteen years old, not tall for her age, but
full-formed and exquisitely proportioned. Her features
were regular, with the “sweet, low brow,” and straight
nose and arched lips of the Grecian profile; her eyes
were of dark and melting hue, and her dark, rich auburn
hair, parted over a forehead of snowy fairness, dropped
in a mass of irregular ringlets down cheeks of carnation
dye. The idea she inspired was that of a richness
and fullness of life.</p>

<p class='c010'>She stood within the door with a smile, awaiting the
pleasure of the stranger, whose knock had summoned
her. Captain Hugh had never seen Agnes Seabright
before, so that he handed her the letter, saying:</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think that this is for you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>She took it, and was about in her haste to break the
seal and possess herself of the contents, when her eyes
alighted on these words, written on the corner: “To
make my little girl acquainted with Mr. Hutton, my
mate and good friend.” Then she raised her eyes from
the letter in her hand to Hugh Hutton’s face. Then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>she offered her hand shyly but kindly, while she said,
simply:</p>

<p class='c010'>“How do you do, Mr. Hutton? Will you walk in and
sit down, and excuse me while I read father’s letter? I
have not heard from him for so long,” she said, as they
walked into the parlor.</p>

<p class='c010'>He sat down in a large flag-bottomed chair and began
to draw figures on the sanded floor with a stick, while
she retired to an end window to read her father’s farewell
letter.</p>

<p class='c010'>Captain Hutton watched her growing pale and paler
as she read the letter to its close—as she folded it and
advanced trembling to his side—as she laid her hand
heavy from faintness on his arm, and speaking in thick,
faltering tones, said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tell me! I don’t—I’m afraid to understand what
this means! But, my father—where is he gone?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hugh took both her hands in his, while the folded
letter fell to the ground, looked full, looked kindly and
gravely into her set and anxious eyes, and answered
slowly:</p>

<p class='c010'>“To heaven, Agnes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He would have held her hands longer, gazed longer
upon that beautiful but troubled countenance, as to impart
his own strength and composure, but she withdrew
her fingers, sank down upon a chair, and covered her
face with her hands. Soon between the fingers copious
tears flowed. Then she arose and slowly left the room.</p>

<p class='c010'>What was to be done with this young and beautiful
girl? To be sure, there was Hugh’s own home on Hutton
Island, and there was Miss Josephine Cotter, Hugh’s
maiden aunt; but the home was so poor, and Miss Joe—so
queer! There was no knowing how Miss Joe might
receive this poor child, so much in need of love and sympathy
and care just now. After ruminating a long time
he could think of no better plan than to at least consult
Miss Joe upon the subject. So, his hours for the evening
being all pre-engaged, he determined to go home
early the next morning to break the news to his aunt.</p>

<hr class='c011'>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>“You must perceive, Aunt Joe, that I’m in a serious
dilemma.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, then, here! take this reel and wind off this
hank o’ yarn, while I foot my stocking. People needn’t
be idle while they’re talking. More idle time is spent
talking than any other way—as if people’s hands and
tongues would not go at the same time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hugh obeyed with a good-humored laugh. At last:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, aunt?” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, Hugh! Now begin, and tell me all over, all
about it, for I don’t know as I understand it—quite!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hugh recapitulated the history of Captain Seabright’s
illness and death, his last will and testament, and finally
the embarrassment in which he found Agnes Seabright
and the relation in which he stood toward her, concluding
with:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, what am I to do with her, aunt?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Marry her, Hugh. There is no home open to the
orphan but this—nor this, unless you marry her first.
You promised to wed her—you mean to wed her—why
not do it at once? Will the marriage rite hurt or inconvenience
you? Just let the marriage ceremony,
which gives you a lawful claim to her, and which gives
her the right to live here in this house as its mistress,
and which will shut the mouths of the gossips for ever—be
performed. ‘An ounce of preventive is better than
a pound of cure,’ even in matters of gossip. Then bring
her here to me. I’ll be a mother to the child. I’ll do
the best I can for her. I’ll make her feel at home, and
make her happy, even on this lonesome island.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The next morning Hugh spent with Agnes Seabright.
And after that he visited her every day, until the orphan’s
tears were nearly dried and the maiden’s heart
won.</p>

<p class='c010'>For the reception of the bride Miss Joe was making
every preparation which she could make without spending,
or, as she called it, “heaving away of” money.
Hugh schemed “to draw all points to one,” so that the
marriage should take place upon the very day on which
he was to sail for Baltimore preparatory to a longer trip
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>to the West Indies. So, very early on a glorious autumn
morning, while the rising sun was shining splendidly
into the chapel windows, the marriage ceremony was
quietly performed in the village church by the village
parson.</p>

<p class='c010'>Immediately after the ceremony was concluded Hugh
tucked Agnes under one arm and Miss Joe under the
other, and hurried down to the beach to get them on
board the boat. He lifted Agnes into the skiff, handed
Miss Joe after her, and, entering himself, laid his hand
vigorously to the oar, and they sped down the stream
and over the bright waters.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a golden morning—grand, exultant, inspiring!
Out before them rolled the boundless, the magnificent
sea, with its myriads beyond myriads of waves, leaping,
flashing, sparkling, scintillating like fluid emeralds in the
dazzling splendor of the morning sun.</p>

<p class='c010'>As he looked upon this scene Hugh’s eyes kindled,
blazed. He did not see how sad was the brow of his
young bride. No! the sea-king had already risen above
the lover.</p>

<p class='c010'>At last the island lay before them like a line of gold.
He rowed swiftly for it. Soon they landed on the glittering
strand. It was here they parted.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And—be kind to my little Agnes!” he whispered, as
he took leave of the old lady.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, Agnes,” he said, as he folded her to his bosom
and pressed his first and farewell kiss upon her lips.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then he sprang into the boat and struck out to sea in
the direction of his vessel, riding at anchor at about a
half league’s distance, and which was to sail with the
tide.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come, Agnes,” said Miss Joe, kindly taking her arm
to draw it within her own.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not yet—not just yet! And, if you please, just let
me watch until the boat gets out of sight.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Honey, it will put your eyes out to try to look upon
this sparkling sea. Come; breakfast is waiting for us,
I know.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wish he had only stayed to breakfast with us! I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>could have parted with him better then, if I had known
he had eaten a good, warm breakfast.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The tide wouldn’t wait, you know, child, and he will
get his breakfast on board his vessel. Why, what’s the
matter, Agnes? I do believe you like him already! I
do believe you’re sorry he’s gone!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He was my only friend! Since father died I was
getting used to him,” said Agnes, bursting into tears.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I declare to man, if it is not wonderful! All
them Huttons had never seemed to value woman’s love—have
every one of them always got more than they
deserved. Come, Agnes; the boat is quite out of sight
now; come home and take a cup of coffee, child; it will
cheer you up.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you think he is safe on board of his vessel yet?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, yes, of course! Come, a cup of coffee is first-rate
for trouble—’cause, you see, I’ve tried it! Come,
honey!”</p>

<p class='c010'>And Miss Joe drew Agnes’ arm within her own and
walked up the isle toward the cottage.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER IX.<br> <span class='large'>HUTTON LODGE.</span></h2>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A snug thatch house; before the door a green;</div>
      <div class='line'>Hens in the middling; ducks and geese are seen;</div>
      <div class='line'>On this side stands a coop; on that a pen;</div>
      <div class='line'>A wood-pile joins.</div>
      <div class='line in36'><i>—Allan Ramsay.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Hutton Lodge, on Hutton’s Island, had been built in
the palmy days of the family’s prosperity.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was to this lodge that Captain Hugh Hutton of
Revolutionary memory had retired with his sole female
relative, his sister-in-law, Miss Josephine Cotter. And
here, after his death, had the good woman continued to
live.</p>

<p class='c010'>And here was Hugh Hutton’s home whenever his ship
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>would be in port. And finally, it was to this lodge, or
cottage, as he called it, that Miss Joe conducted her
young charge, the widowed bride.</p>

<p class='c010'>The days were all occupied with work—yes, hard
work. All day long the whir of the flying shuttle, and
the dull, monotonous clap-clap of the warp-rammer
would be heard, as Miss Joe sat at her loom; and the
hum of the great spinning-wheel as Agnes stood and
spun. Agnes had no motive under the sun for her industry
but Hugh’s interest and Hugh’s pleasure. To
become an efficient help-meet for Hugh—to be an industrious
and saving little housekeeper for Hugh’s profit.
And when Miss Joe praised her docility and perseverance,
poor girl, she felt as though she were receiving
Hugh’s approval. Sometimes she would be tempted to
think a little hardly of his having gone to sea so instantly
after their marriage, but when this thought took the hue
of blame she banished it at once. But—did he love her
at all, when he could leave her so soon, and with so little
emotion? She feared not. Would he ever love her as
she loved him—as she wished to be loved? She knew
herself to be beautiful and attractive. She would have
been an idiot not to have known it. In her deep and
secret heart, while never acknowledging her purpose to
herself, she sought to adapt herself to her circumstances
and duties, and fit herself to win Hugh’s approval and
love. Such were her silent dreams and reveries by day,
while her spinning-wheel whirled under her hand, and
the incessant clap-clap of Miss Joe’s loom sounded on
her ear from the other corner. And so November and
the greater part of December passed, when a letter came
from Hugh announcing his speedy return home.</p>

<p class='c010'>At length the important day dawned; it was Christmas
Eve. The snow was two feet deep on the ground,
and crusted with a coat of ice thick enough to bear the
heaviest footsteps without breaking through. The day
was cold, crisp, but clear.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was nearly sunset when Agnes went up into her
room for the fiftieth time that day to look at the sea
for a sail. It was very cold, and there was no fire, so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>Agnes thought just to give one sweeping glance over
the waters and then retire, when her eye alighted on a
distant sail making toward the isle. She wrapped a
large woolen shawl around herself and sat down to
watch what might come. The vessel bore down rapidly
upon the island. When within about a quarter of a mile
and bearing away westward toward the mainland, she
lowered a boat with two rowers, who pulled swiftly toward
the island landing. Agnes recognized Hugh and
one of his crew. She started and ran downstairs, exclaiming
as she burst into the kitchen:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hugh is coming! Hugh is almost here, aunt! I saw
him in the boat!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is he?” said the old lady quietly. “Well, then,
honey, do you take some water upstairs in—in—in my—no,
your room for him to wash, while I put up the supper,
so that he needn’t wait.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Agnes complied, arranging everything neatly and conveniently,
and then returned to the kitchen to assist Miss
Joe in arranging the supper on the table.</p>

<p class='c010'>They had scarcely completed their task before a sharp
rap was instantly followed by the pushing open of the
door, and Hugh entered alone, vigorously stamping the
snow off his feet.</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Joe looked at the snow and her soiled floor, and
sighed heavily and shook her head before she even advanced
to welcome her nephew.</p>

<p class='c010'>That greeting over, Hugh extended his hand to his
young wife with a “How do you do, Agnes, my dear?”
and threw himself heavily into a great armchair by the
fire.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yes! it seemed but too true! The little love Agnes
had inspired him with during their short acquaintance
had all evaporated during the not much longer sea
voyage!</p>

<p class='c010'>Would he go to his room and change his dress?
Would he have water? Everything was in readiness for
him upstairs.</p>

<p class='c010'>No! he would stay here in this armchair by the chimney
corner until they should sit down to tea. He did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>not wish to give anybody any trouble. He begged that
they would take none. Besides, he was so glad to see
his good aunt and little Agnes that he did not wish to
lose a single moment of their company for the little time
that he had to stay with them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then Miss Joe invited him, as soon as he should feel
himself sufficiently rested, to take off his overcoat and
sit down to supper.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then Hugh arose, and Agnes quietly took his hat and
Miss Joe drew off his overcoat and inducted him into
his seat at the table. The supper was a feast. Besides
the usual indispensables of coffee, rich cream, fresh
butter and light bread, there were oysters and wild duck,
stewed fruit, cakes, and so on.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hugh asked Agnes how she liked her island home.
This was the first question he had put to her since his
return.</p>

<p class='c010'>Agnes answered that she liked it very well. Did she
not find it lonesome?</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, indeed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Poor Agnes in her desire to be agreeable was totally
unconscious of her falsehood.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then Hugh turned to Miss Joe, inquiring kindly after
her health.</p>

<p class='c010'>Oh, her health was always good, and had never been
better than at this moment.</p>

<p class='c010'>When tea was over and the table cleared away they
all drew around the fire. Miss Joe, with her reel and
yarn, and Agnes sitting idle in compliment of Hugh’s
return.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hugh, on his part, began to tell them of his voyage,
of his success, of his happiness to find himself at home
again; of a certain large and well-filled box which he
hoped might be acceptable to his aunt and Agnes.
Whereupon Miss Joe began an exordium on the sin of
“heaving away” money, which was gently cut short by
Hugh, who, rising up, announced that he really ought to
have been back to his vessel an hour before, and that
he must now take leave of them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“When shall we see you again?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>“To-morrow, about noon.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What! not before?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No; I have to go to Huttontown.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, you’ll stay when you do come?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am afraid I cannot promise you, indeed, aunt; but,
at all events, I will see you every day, and make it a
point to spend the whole of Christmas Day with you.
Good-night, aunt! Good-night, Agnes, my dear!”</p>

<p class='c010'>A week passed, during which Hugh was for the most
part at the cottage.</p>

<p class='c010'>New Year’s Day dawned. It was the last day he had
to stay at home. They spent this holiday very much as
they had spent Christmas Day—going to church at Huttontown
in the forenoon and returning to the isle to dinner.
After dinner Hugh took them to the mainland,
where he hired a sleigh and gave them a long, fine run
over the frozen snow.</p>

<p class='c010'>The next morning Hugh came early—unknown to
Aunt Joe, however, who was outdoors giving directions
to Pontius Pilate about his day’s work. She had returned
to the kitchen and was busily engaged, as usual,
at her loom, when she was very much astounded by a
noise on the stairs as of a man’s heavy footsteps, and
the stair-door was pushed open and Hugh appeared,
porter-like, with a great trunk—Agnes’ trunk—upon his
shoulders, a basket in his hand, and a bandbox under
his arm, and followed by Agnes herself, dressed in traveling
gear, with another basket and a bundle.</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Joe stared in amazement, without being able to
articulate.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, what in the name of all the saints in heaven
does all this here mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am going to take Agnes to sea with me,” said
Hugh.</p>

<p class='c010'>The old lady broke out into loud sobs for company.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hugh set his trunk, bandbox, and basket down upon
the floor and set himself to the task of comforting and
soothing both.</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Joe was the first to recover.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come here, Aggy, my darling child! You have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>like a darter to me, honey. Kiss me again. Since you
will go, Aggy, God bless you, my child! God bless you!
I shall comfort myself very well by weaving cloth and
flannel, and making counterpanes for you against you
come back. Good-by!” And she embraced Agnes
fondly and lifted and placed in her hands the basket and
bundle.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hugh now came forward, and, for the second time,
bade his aunt farewell; and, resuming his bundles, trunk,
bandbox, basket, etc., set out for the beach.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If I’d only known, I’d a’ had a cup of coffee ready
for you,” said the old lady; and she looked really pitiable
as she stood there in her solitude, watching them as they
went down to the beach and embarked on board the little
boat and sped toward the distant ship. Having with
the aid of a spyglass seen them embark on board the
ship, Miss Joe turned into her lonely home and began
preparing her solitary meal.</p>

Chester and General Garnet, and six months since the
departure of Hugh Hutton and Agnes upon their sea
voyage.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>It is June, and the scene is the terrace in front of

<p class='c010'>Alice occupies a rustic seat under the shadow of a

delicate, almost sylph-like, with her fair, blond beauty
and airy, white muslin wrapper. She is calmly pursuing
a piece of fine, white, knitting-work—that favorite busy
idleness of all Maryland ladies. At her feet is a very
small basket, containing her keys and the ball of lamb’s
wool yarn from which she knits. Near her stands a
young mulatto hand-maid of about ten years of age.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lower down upon a step of the terrace sits her
daughter Alice, or Elsie, as she was called for distinction’s
sake. Elsie is now a very beautiful child, promising
to be much more beautiful than her mother had
ever been. She strangely united the most beautiful features
of both parents. She had the delicate, Grecian
features, fair, roseate complexion, golden hair, and blue
eyes of her mother, with the passionate, veiled gaze and
bewildering smile of her father. She had a finer vital
and sanguine temperament than either could have possessed;
a more rounded form, more elastic motion, a
more joyous expression, a more gladsome cadence in her
speech and in her laughter. Elsie sat sketching an elm
tree from nature—the tree stood before her, at some distance
on the lawn. She was bending over her drawing-board,
that rested on her lap, until her fair ringlets almost
concealed her rosy cheeks. She, also, wore a simple
white muslin dress that harmonized well with her
blooming beauty. Behind her, bending over her, stood
a youth of sixteen; but for height, for breadth of shoulders
and depth of chest, and manly and athletic proportions
generally he might have been taken for twenty
years of age. He was a very handsome boy, with bright
chestnut hair, waving around a massive brow and relieving
and beautifying its heavy strength, gracefully as
foliage shades rock. He seemed to have just returned
from gunning, for he wore a dress of forest green, his
cap lay at his feet, his pointers were near, and one hand
rested upon a fowling-piece, while with the other he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>pointed alternately to the elm tree and the drawing, giving
Elsie some instruction in her work. His dark gray
eyes, full of thought, truth, and affection, were fixed
upon her.</p>

<p class='c010'>And while they pursued their work Alice, from her
rustic seat, watched them. Alice, looking as serenely
happy as though her heart had never been broken, her
brain never been crazed by calamity, anguish, and despair
verging upon madness; as healthful, amiable, and
self-possessed as though she had never sworn in her
frenzy that she could not survive the severance from
Sinclair; that neither moral, intellectual, nor physical nature
could stand the test—the misery of a life with
Garnet.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Divine Providence is kind, and nature is full of
remedial power. We have all strength given us according
to our need. If our joys are greater in anticipation
than in realization, so certainly are our sorrows.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alice, in the terrible storm of passion that had temporarily
dethroned her reason, believed that she could
not outlive her marriage; yet she had lived twelve years,
and was comparatively happy—possibly happier than
many a girl who had married for love, or its semblance.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is true that from the hour she awoke from the
strange torpor that immediately followed her marriage
her religious principles had taught her to turn from the
memory of Sinclair, whenever that memory recurred.
She prayed against, she strove against it, wrenched her
thoughts forcibly from it, and riveted them to something
else. And her prayers and struggles had produced this
happy effect. The image of Sinclair had faded away
with the brightest visions of her girlhood. And now
that that typhoon of youthful passion had long passed,
and even its memory had almost faded away, her genial,
affectionate, religious nature made her happy. With
such a nature Alice could not live without forming attachments
to those around her. He must have been a
terrible brute who could not have been blessed with
some portion of her affection by simply living in the
house with her for twelve years. And General Garnet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>was not exactly a brute. He was very handsome, graceful,
and accomplished and habitually polite. And now
that time had long worn out his jealousy he had ceased
all undignified and ungentlemanly interference with his
wife’s specially feminine occupations and associations.
Alice was happy with her housekeeping, her garden, her
dairy, her country neighbors, her favorite Magnus, and
her little daughter. Yet, had the Angel of Destiny whispered
to her heart this alternative: “Your daughter! two
fates await her—to die in her childhood, or live to be an
unwilling bride—choose for her!” Alice would have answered
with a shudder and without a moment’s hesitation:
“Let her die in her childhood rather. Let her die
now, rather!” And to have saved her from the misery
of wedding one she could not love, Alice would have
been content to lay her heart’s only treasure, her idolized
child, in the grave.</p>

<p class='c010'>But no such question of Destiny had yet called back
the memory of the past, and Alice was happy as she
drew out her knitting-needle and smiled at the boy and
girl on the terrace.</p>

<p class='c010'>At last the sketch was finished and Magnus pronounced
it perfect, and threw his shoulders back with a
yawn of relief, and brought his hands together with
a ring, exclaiming, as he turned to Alice:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, cousin, let me order the horses and let us ride
at once to the beach. Why, here’s Goliah come from the
post office—with a letter, too!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is from the general, madam,” continued Magnus,
receiving the letter from the boy and handing it to Alice.
She opened and glanced through it. Then turning to
the expectant child, she said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Elsie, your father will be home this evening. He
will bring with him Judge Wylie, Mr. Ulysses Wylie,
Mr. Hardcastle, and Mr. Lionel Hardcastle. He requests
me to have supper ready for the party.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Alice was soon superintending the preparations for
supper. She had a good deal of the pride of the housekeeper
and the hostess about her. Every Maryland
woman has.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>And that evening General Garnet entertained his
friends to his heart’s content. It was a sort of little
political party, at which Mrs. Garnet was not expected
to appear.</p>

<p class='c010'>After supper Lionel and Ulysses left the grave conclave
of politicians to the discussion of Congress and
canvas-back ducks, and came out upon the green.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lionel was full of the new good fortune that had befallen
him. The dearest wish of his life was gratified;
his father had at last obtained for him a midshipman’s
warrant and he was going to sea. Alice looked at the
wild and willful youth with much anxiety, and wished in
her heart that it might have been otherwise; that he
might have been forced to stay under his father’s protection
and surveillance.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lionel also, in his frank, off-hand manner, informed
his Cousin Magnus there before them all that his father
had not forgotten him, either; that he had arranged with
a celebrated physician of Baltimore to receive him as a
student.</p>

<p class='c010'>Magnus received this news with feelings of blended
pain and pleasure—pain at the thought of leaving his
dear “Cousin Alice” and her beautiful child—pleasure
at the idea of the opening prospect of study, improvement,
and independence.</p>

<p class='c010'>Elsie never thought of the evil; she only thought of
the good; she threw her arms around his neck and wished
him joy and success.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Alice was much more depressed than the occasion
seemed to warrant. Again she caught herself wishing
that young people could possibly remain at home. All
partings depressed her. The idea of these saddened her.</p>

<p class='c010'>Was the cloud on her beautiful face really sorrow at
the certainty of losing her loving boy-friend, or was it
the shadow of coming events? Alice sighed heavily as
she watched the young people dance. And at an early
hour she recalled them to the house, served them with
refreshments, and, pleading great fatigue, dismissed
them all to their several chambers.</p>

<p class='c010'>She then threw herself languidly into the great easy-chair
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>to await the breaking up of the party and the appearance
of General Garnet. She had scarcely had an
opportunity of speaking to him since his return.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was not very long before she heard the gentle,
cheerful bustle of the departing guests, and the ringing
tones of Judge Wylie’s voice above all the rest, inviting
everybody to Point Pleasant the next evening for
the purpose of meeting everybody else.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the last guest had departed General Garnet entered
Alice’s parlor.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Up yet, Mrs. Garnet! Have I been so unfortunate
as to disturb your rest?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No—oh, no! I think you were very quiet for a party
of gentlemen—not at all like the noisy parties Judge
Wylie gathers. No; I had no opportunity of welcoming
you home,” she said rising and offering her hand.
“Have you had a pleasant journey?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A successful one, madam, which is better. I think
that there can be no reasonable doubt that D—— will
carry the majority of votes in the districts through which
we traveled.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Her next question was a housekeeper’s query:</p>

<p class='c010'>“How did you like your supper, and were your guests
pleased?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All was very well, Alice—and, could they be else
than pleased after so triumphant a canvass?” said he,
taking a seat and motioning Alice to do the same. “I
have something to propose to you, Alice, in regard to
our daughter.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Our daughter!” repeated she, with a vague fear
creeping over her heart.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, our girl. I scarcely approve the loose, irregular
manner in which her education is conducted at
home.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It may appear to you so, because her occupations and
amusements are so various; but, indeed, her habits—all
habits, I mean, upon which health and improvement depend—are
very regular; and for the rest, human nature
itself—health, improvement—require some little irregularity.
The rain does not fall and the sun shine upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>set days. See what a bright, healthful, happy, intelligent
child Elsie is! Part of that is owing to her habits.
She rises very early, breakfasts early, rides with Magnus
or one of the servants, returns and devotes three hours
to her books.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, all that is very well, but there should be a systematic
course of study, which, I fancy, you are not
quite competent to direct.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Try me,” said Alice. “I have not been idle all my
life, nor all my life occupied exclusively with the eating,
drinking, and wearing interests of our family. I have
found time to cultivate my mind, for Elsie’s sake. I
have read and reflected much. I expected to be Elsie’s
only teacher. I have been, hitherto. And I wish, above
all things, to continue to be. Then I shall feel better
assured of her best good; better assured that her affections
will not run to waste while her intellect is cultivated.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘A little learning is a dangerous thing.’ It makes
anyone conceited—especially, I think, a woman who has
few opportunities of comparing her ignorance with other
people’s knowledge,” muttered General Garnet to himself.
Then slightly raising his voice, he said: “No,
Alice, it will not do. Elsie cannot remain under your
tuition. I have other and wiser plans for her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose,” said Alice, in a low voice, “that you are
thinking of employing a private governess or tutor.
Well, if you think it best——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, Alice, I have no faith in governesses, and I
totally disapprove of private tutors for young ladies. My
intention is to send Elsie to a boarding-school for the
next six or seven years.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To boarding-school for seven years! Elsie, my darling,
my only one, away from me for so long! She!—so
young!—to go among total strangers for so long!
No! you cannot mean it!” exclaimed Alice, rising and
wringing her hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sit down, Mrs. Garnet, and listen to me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Alice sank into her seat again, and listened.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is no female academy of the first class in this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>country, I am sorry to say; none, at least, at which I
should like to place our only daughter.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Alice’s hopes raised; she thought she might have misunderstood
what he had said before—her mind was so
confused. She hastened to say:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, then, you are thinking of some very accomplished
woman, or some highly intellectual graduate of
William and Mary, who, though not exactly an ordinary
governess or tutor, may be induced to come and take
charge of our little girl for a very liberal salary?”</p>

<p class='c010'>General Garnet waved his hand impatiently.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hear me out, if you please, Mrs. Garnet. I have
told you that I dislike private tutors and governesses! I
dislike the idea of a stranger domesticated in the house
very much. I said, besides, that there was no boarding-school
in the country to which I could care to trust our
daughter. I intend to send Elsie to England.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To England!” murmured Alice, in an inaudible
voice, growing very pale and sinking back in her chair.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, to England. My friend, General A—— is going
out there as minister. He takes all his family, of
course. He expects to remain abroad many years. In
talking over with me his prospects, among other things
for which he congratulated himself was the opportunity
that his residence abroad would afford giving his daughters
a very superior education. While we conversed, I
spoke of Alice, regretting the limited means of female
education afforded by our country. Well, he proposed
that I should commit my daughter to his charge, to go
to England, and be put to school with his own. He
pressed this favor very earnestly upon me. The opportunity
was one not likely to occur again, and therefore
not to be lightly thrown away. Finally I accepted his
offer. It was all arranged between us. The embassy
sails from Baltimore in two weeks, and before that time
Elsie must be ready to join the family.”</p>

<hr class='c011'>

<p class='c010'>In the course of the month their departure took place
from the neighborhood.</p>

<p class='c010'>Elsie Garnet, with many tears, left for her English
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>school under the protection of the American minister to
the Court of St. James.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lionel Hardcastle sailed as midshipman aboard the
United States ship <i>Falcon</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>And Magnus Hardcastle, taking a most affectionate
leave of his beautiful friend, Alice, and promising many
letters, left for Baltimore to enter upon the study of
medical science in the office of a distinguished physician.</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in20'>“At eve a sail</div>

      <div class='line in36'><i>—Crabbe.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It was a bright evening near the last of October. The
mail had just come in, and brought Alice letters to
gladden her heart for many months. There was a letter
from Magnus—that strong, confident, joyous Magnus,
who always saw so much good and glory in the future.
And there was one post-marked London, and ship-marked
<i>Belle Agnes</i>, from Elsie—the healthful, hopeful,
happy Elsie, who always made the best of everything,
and was gladsome everywhere. No letter could be more
replete with the tenderest filial affection than hers, yet
there was not a word of home-sickness, or sorrow, or
discontent in it. It was full of genial life, of happy love,
and confident hope.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alice kissed the loving letter again and again, and
walked about, happy, restless, overjoyed. General Garnet
was away from home again, as he was about half
the time. And Alice, after she had read the welcome
letter to all the confidential servants who loved Elsie,
bethought herself—by way of expending some of the
extra life she had received—of going over to see Miss
Joe and telling the old lady that her nephew’s vessel was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>in port, for that she had got letters by it. She had frequently
gone on to Hutton’s Isle to cheer the lonely old
woman, and she knew the old soul would also be delighted
to hear from Elsie.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alice told Diogenes, the colored servant, to get the
one-horse chaise and take her over to Huttontown. The
chaise was soon ready. Alice entered it and was driven
by Diogenes over to the village. She left the chaise at
the ‘Neptune and Pan,’ and, attended by Diogenes, went
down to the beach. The afternoon was very clear and
calm:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The air was still and the water still,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>and she felt no uneasiness in trusting herself to the little
skiff and the one oar to the old servant.</p>

<p class='c010'>As they glided over the silent waters the profound stillness
of the air and water was vaguely disturbed by a
distant, deep-toned, solemn moan, swelling on the horizon
like the breeze upon a mammoth harp-string, and
dying away in the deep of silence.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did you hear that?” asked Alice of her attendant.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, ma’am, I heard nothing, Miss Ally,” replied the
obtuse negro.</p>

<p class='c010'>And Alice thought she was mistaken. The bay was
perfectly smooth, yet it seemed to Alice that the vast
body of water under them just perceptibly rose and fell,
as though instinct with life and breath. The little skiff
sped like an arrow across the bosom of the waters, and
in something less than half an hour cleared the distance
between the mainland and the isle. The old negro stuck
his oar into the sand and shoved the boat up high and
dry upon the beach, so that his mistress could step out
dry-shod.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Does not the wind blow around this bleak island
even when it is calm along the coast of the mainland?”
asked Alice, as she gathered her flapping veil and shawl
more closely around her and stepped out upon the
strand.</p>

<p class='c010'>“La, no, Miss Ally, ma’am; it never doesn’t, of course;
dough when der is a win’, it has more ’siderable of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>clean sweep here than anywhere else. No, Miss Ally, no,
ma’am; but de win’ do seem for to be a-risin’.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come, let us hurry on to the house, for really it is
quite fresh,” said she, drawing her veil down over her
face and under her shawl, and wrapping the latter more
closely around her, and striking into the narrow path
leading through the cornfield and up to the house. But
when she had got about halfway up the hill the wind
took her so fiercely, flapping her skirts about her feet,
flapping her bonnet and veil about her face, that she was
forced to turn around from the wind to recover her
breath and strength.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can scarcely face this gale! How very suddenly it
has sprung up!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, ma’am,” replied the old negro, looking uneasily
at the sky; “I—I—mos’ wish us hadn’t a-ventured out!
I—I—I do hope us aint a-gwine to have a squeeling,
knocking storm afore us gits back!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, it is entirely too late in the season for an equinoctial
storm,” replied Alice, following his glance to the
sky. “The wind has blown a few straggling clouds up
from the horizon, but it does not look at all threatening.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah, Miss Ally, you don’t know, honey! Der aint
never no good in dem ar switchy mare’s tails!” replied
Diogenes, pointing to the long, black, ragged clouds flying
before the wind. Holding her head down, and hugging
her shawl tightly about her, Alice pushed on toward
the house.</p>

<p class='c010'>Looking up as she reached the top of the hill she saw
Miss Joe with her head far out of the gable end loft
window, with an old spyglass in her hand, leveling it
out to sea. Miss Joe lowered her glass for a moment and
perceived Alice, and shouted to her above the blast:</p>

<p class='c010'>“How do you do, Mrs. Garnet? Hasn’t this here bluff
of wind come up sudden? ’Taint a-going to be anything
but a wind, though, I believe. Come up to the house,
honey. I’ll be down from here about the time you get
up. I have just been looking out after that there vessel
down the bay, as I think must be Hugh’s, seeing I’m expecting
him. I spied that there craft about two hours
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>ago. She was making slow headway, because the tide
was strong agin her. Now she seems farther off than
before. I shouldn’t wonder if this gust of wind, with the
current, didn’t blow her out to sea agin. I hope it aint
nothing but a gust, though, that’ll soon be over. The
wind bluffs around as if it were a-going to change too;
then it’ll be fair for her, and she’ll scud along fast enough
before it. Come up to the house, honey! I’m coming
down.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Alice reached the garden gate just as Miss Joe opened
the house door and came out to meet her, her clothes all
blown aslant and flapping about as if they would go
over her head, but looking so hardy, sturdy, storm-proof,
with her shining face rubicund with joy and welcome,
Alice laughed out to see her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dear Miss Joe! you look chirping as a frosty morning!
It enlivens one to see you! I have heard of people
who, going out for wool, returned shorn. I have
come to cheer you, and shall go home gladdened! You
look so chirp!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, honey! I have enough to chirrup me. I’m heern
from Hugh and his wife. You saw that sloop in at Hutton’s
Harbor? Well, that there sloop, she came from
the port of Baltimore, where she spoke the <i>Belle Agnes</i>,
jest in from Liverpool, and brought a letter from Captain
Hutton, saying as he should run down here soon as
ever he unloaded his cargo and took in some freight for
this here port. His letter says how Agnes is going for
to stay long o’ me now. ’Deed, I reckon she’s had
enough o’ sea-faring, a’ready!” said Miss Joe, as she
straddled on toward the gate and opened it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Very soon the neat tea-table was set out and a repast,
delicate and luxurious as any epicure could have desired,
spread upon it. And Miss Joe arranged Alice in a comfortable
seat at the side of the table near the fire, and
as she poured out the fragrant tea she told all the story
of the letter she had got from Hugh. How they had
made such a prosperous voyage; how Hugh was going
to stay home for three months; how Agnes was not going
away again at all; and how she supposed Agnes was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>cured of her curiosity to see the ocean. And through
all her talk Alice saw how much family affection was in
that old frost-bitten heart of hers.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sun went down. The wind seemed to lull. Alice
arose and put on her bonnet and shawl for a start. Old
Diogenes buttoned his coat up to his chin, and took up
his old felt hat to attend her. Miss Joe threw her check
apron over her head to accompany them, and the little
party opened the door and set out for the beach. The
eyes of old Diogenes rolled</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“From heaven to earth, from earth to heaven,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>in a great trouble!</p>

<p class='c010'>Though the sun had but just set, the sky was no
longer blue, but of a lurid, metallic, coppery color, mottled
over by leaden clouds, athwart which, and lower
down, scudded huge, black, inky masses of vapor, driven
wildly before the wind that had shifted and was again
rising. Lower down and nearer the earth flew other
clouds, flocks of wild sea fowl, screaming frightfully and
dashing hither and thither, or settling upon the island
as for shelter from the coming tempest. Such was the
sky.</p>

<p class='c010'>The look of the sea was still more terrible. The surface
of the water was very rough, the waves breaking
into foam as though frost were thrown up from the
depths of the sea. The whole enormous mass of waters
was rising with a vast, slow, mighty swell, as though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>some monstrous under-power were laboring to upheave
the ocean from its bed and shatter it into precipices and
caverns. And all around the lurid horizon boomed the
low, deep, awful sound of the coming storm.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It will never do to try to cross the water to-night,
my dear child,” said Miss Joe, solemnly and fearfully.
“We’re going to have an awful storm, and it may burst
upon us at any minute.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“’Deed, Miss Ally, child, it’s wery unsafe—wery!
Don’t let’s be a-tempting o’ Providence! Don’t!” said
Diogenes, his teeth chattering with cold and terror.</p>

<p class='c010'>Just then the voice of the wind wailed across the
waters like the shriek of a lost spirit, and the salt spray
of the sea was dashed in their faces. The sky seemed
to be settling down over the isle, and the waters, black,
heavy, and dark! The mighty sea was heaving, settling,
rising to meet the lowered sky! The vapor of the clouds
and waves seemed intermingling! The rising wind
howled and shrieked!</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, child, if you venter upon the water this evening,
you’ll row to the Kingdom of Heaven,” said Miss
Joe. “Turn—hurry back! We must get to the house
as fast as possible, or the storm will be upon us! Child,
alive! what are you standing looking out to sea for? I
do believe you are more afraid of braving General Garnet’s
anger than that of the wind and sea themselves.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should not have come,” said Alice, turning shuddering,
away from the beach.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, you should!” replied Miss Joe; “and now you
should come back! Hurry! hurry! hurry! Look at that
mass of black cloud rushing like a demon up the sky!”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was now very dark, and they hastened on toward
the house. They reached it as a furious blast of wind
drove them against its walls. They went in the house.
Shutters were closed, props were placed against the
doors to assist the old locks in holding them against the
fury of the storm. And as the room was now pitch dark,
except by the lurid light of the smoldering fire, Miss
Joe lit a candle and set it on the mantelpiece. Alice sat
down in the chimney-corner armchair, very pale.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>The storm raged, shrieked and howled around the
house. Hourly its violence increased; tenfold the crash
of falling trees, twisted off at the roots, the clatter of
rattling tiles and shingles, reft off and rained down from
the roof; the scream of the frightened water-fowl, the
howl of the alarmed cattle, mingled with the shriek of
the wind and the thunder of the waves in the grand
diapason of nature’s wildest, most terrific harmony.</p>

<p class='c010'>At last came the awful crisis of the storm. The wind
had</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Paused to gather its fearful breath.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>and now rushed upon the house with the invincible
power of a storming battery, with a sound, a shock, as
if two planets had met in fatal concussion. The earth
trembled; the massive roof of the strong house was torn
off and hurled aloft; heavy blocks of sandstone came
clattering down from the topmost wall, and then the rain
fell its vast sheets, as if “all heaven was opened.” And
now came a sound more terrific than that of an advancing
army!</p>

<p class='c010'>The ocean was upon them in its might!</p>

<p class='c010'>Speechless with awe, like those in the immediate presence
of sudden death, Alice and Miss Joe remained
locked in each other’s arms. The old negro ran wildly
about, like one perfectly distracted, screaming:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, my God! my God! we shall be all drowned in
this very house, like blind puppies in a tub! Oh, will
nobody ’fess me o’ my sins? Oh, Lord! I ’fess to de
breaking o’ all de ’mandments, rather dan miss absolushum
for dem as I has broke!”</p>

<p class='c010'>And so he ran about and raved, while Alice and Miss
Joe remained motionless, waiting for death where they
sat.</p>

<p class='c010'>The water that dashed against the wall was no longer
the rain, but the sea—the sea cannonading the house!</p>

<p class='c010'>An hour like an eternity passed, during which the
waves, with deafening sounds, stormed the walls, and the
inmates waited for death. Then the horrible tempest
seemed to abate; the ocean seemed to be retiring.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>Oh, were the waves indeed receding, or was it only
one of those fatal pauses, during which the storm fiend
gathered new strength for destruction?</p>

<p class='c010'>Alice, fearful, hopeful, raised her head, doubtful of the
reprieve from immediate death.</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Joe clasped her closer in her arms, but listened.</p>

<p class='c010'>Diogenes stopped in his wild walk and began to praise
all the saints.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yes, the ocean was certainly receding. They were
saved! But now, amidst their joy, came a knell of doom!</p>

<p class='c010'>The signal gun of a ship in distress!</p>

<p class='c010'>No one knew how often that knell had pealed before.
It could not have been heard, amid the deafening noise
of the waves, any more than the report of a single cannon
could have been distinguished in the thunder of a million
others. The sound struck to the hearts of all
present.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh!” said Miss Joe, “that ship! that ship! It is the
very ship I spied—I know it is—I know it is! And,
oh! it may be the ship of Hugh!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Again the minute gun boomed over the sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Heaven, how I pity them! What can be the
nature of their danger? The storm has almost ceased;
if they could live through that terrific tempest, surely
they can save themselves now. What can be the danger
to which they are exposed now?” asked Alice.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The ship, tossed about so in the horrible storm, must
a’ sprung a leak. Oh, if it should be Hugh’s ship!” replied
Miss Joe.</p>

<p class='c010'>Again the minute gun wailed across the waters.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And, oh!” exclaimed Alice, wringing her hands, “if
there is one thing worse than imminent danger or death
to one’s own, it is to be in perfect safety and to hear,
near by, the cry of others in extremity, and to be unable
to give them aid!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Once more the minute gun wailed across the waters.
It seemed the voice of a last appeal.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My God, I can scarcely stand this!” exclaimed Alice,
shuddering, cowering, stopping her ears, while Miss Joe
walked about, groaning, groaning, groaning!</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>But once more the minute gun wailed across the
waters. It seemed the voice of a last reproach.</p>

<p class='c010'>The two women and the old negro could do absolutely
nothing to help the dying ship. They felt their own
safety as a shame, and covered their heads to shut out
the sound of death. They need not have done so.</p>

<p class='c010'>The minute gun wailed no more across the waters.
The voice was silenced for ever!</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, my God! my God! she is gone down! she is
gone down!” screamed Miss Joe, wrought up to an
agony of terror and grief beyond all self-control.</p>

<p class='c010'>The dread silence that followed was more insufferable
than the terrific storm in its utmost fury had been—than
the awful voice of the minute gun, in its vain appeal,
had been! It was long after midnight now. Miss Joe,
unable longer to bear the awful pause of fate, went and
pulled open the door and looked out.</p>

<p class='c010'>The wind had lulled, the rain had ceased, the waves
had gone down, the storm was nearly over. Yet in the
deep darkness she could only guess the wild ruin that
had been wrought around. The sky hung over the
waters black as a pall, yet by the phosphoric light of the
sea that still moved and sparkled she discovered a dark
object, like the hulk of a huge vessel, disappear under
the waves.</p>

<p class='c010'>And, hush! What sound is that, low and distinct, in
the deep silence of the awful night? The sound of approaching
footsteps and voices hurrying on, and now
very near.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Light another candle, for God’s sake! some people
are coming. God send it may be Hugh and his men!
Light another candle, quick! and thrust it into a lantern!”
exclaimed Miss Joe, hastening into the house.</p>

<p class='c010'>And before the light of the other candle blazed, the
room was filled with sailors, storm-beaten, dripping wet,
two of the foremost of whom bore the body of a fainting
woman in their arms.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was Agnes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where is Hugh—where is your captain? My God!
where is Hugh?” exclaimed Miss Joe, as her eyes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>roamed over this wild party in the vain quest of her
nephew.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We left the captain on the deck of his vessel. He
refused to leave it while a man remained on board. We
are going back for him, and half a dozen others,” said
the mate, looking about in haste for a place to lay Agnes;
then, putting her in the arms of old Dodgy, he turned,
with three others of the men, and left the house for the
beach.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Too late! too late! I saw the ship go down myself!”
exclaimed Miss Joe, beside herself with grief.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What must I do with this here young ’oman, Miss
Ally?” inquired Diogenes of his mistress.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Take her upstairs, Diogenes, and I will go up and
attend to her,” said Alice. And leaving Miss Joe and
the shipwrecked sailors below, Alice followed the old
negro with his burden upstairs.</p>

<p class='c010'>But there a scene of ruin met her startled gaze. The
roof had been reft from the house in the storm; the rain
had poured through the ceiling of the loft and drenched
the bed-chambers. One of the beds, however, being in
a more protected angle of the room, was comparatively
dry. This Alice turned over, and upon this the old negro
was directed to lay his insensible burden.</p>

<p class='c010'>While Alice was rubbing and chafing the cold, cold
hands and feet of the shipwrecked girl, a loud cry of
despair came up from below.</p>

<p class='c010'>She hastened downstairs to know the cause.</p>

<p class='c010'>The mate had returned from a fruitless errand. The
<i>Belle Agnes</i> had gone down with all left on board, and
among them the brave and generous Captain Hugh
Hutton!</p>

<hr class='c011'>

<p class='c010'>Within the next three dreadful hours, “in night and
storm and darkness,” a man-child was born—son of the
storm and the wreck—heir of a desert and a ruin!</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in14'>Alas! It desolately stands</div>
      <div class='line'>Without a roof, the gates fallen from their band,</div>
      <div class='line'>The casements all broke down, no chimney left!</div>
      <div class='line in34'><i>—Allan Ramsay.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The sun rose next morning upon a scene of ruin that
defies description.</p>

<p class='c010'>The house was almost a wreck. The roof, the chimneys,
and the shutters of the upper story were gone.
The windows were shattered and driven in.</p>

<p class='c010'>The grounds also were literally laid waste. All traces
of field, and garden, and flower yard were washed away.
Trees were torn up by the roots, fences were leveled,
outbuildings blown down, and all swept away by the
flood. Cattle and poultry were drowned, and their
bodies carried off by the sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yes! the isle was indeed a desert, and the house was
a ruin, with the exception of the lower story, which, having
been built of stronger material, and being less exposed
to the violence of the wind, had remained entire.</p>

<p class='c010'>If the scene without was wretched, the scene within
was scarcely less so.</p>

<p class='c010'>The shipwrecked sailors had gone down to the beach
for the purpose of searching for the bodies of the
drowned men, if, perchance, they might have been
thrown up, and of hailing any boat that might pass
within hail.</p>

<p class='c010'>Agnes and her child had been removed from the open
and exposed upper chamber to the lower one, which was
more comfortable. Alice, forgetful of her own fears and
cares, bestowed upon the unfortunate young woman the
most affectionate attention. Miss Joe, broken-hearted
and half crazy, yet still governed by her inveterate habits
of order and industry, went about putting things to
rights, groaning, wringing her hands, and getting breakfast.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>Diogenes brought wood and water, and stood
shivering and waiting orders without the door.</p>

<p class='c010'>Very soon after sunrise General Garnet, with two of
his servants, arrived from the mainland. The wild ruin
that reigned around, the deep distress that prevailed
within the house, arrested all speech of blame upon his
lips. He kissed Alice, expressing his gratitude to
Heaven that she was saved. He condoled with Miss
Joe, said that he would send over workmen to repair the
house, offered any other assistance in his power, and requested
to know in what manner he could serve her.
But Miss Joe shook her head dolefully, said that she had
always lived without alms, and that she could not receive
any now; that she had not very long to live, but
hoped she should not die a pauper.</p>

<p class='c010'>After breakfast General Garnet took Alice home.</p>

<p class='c010'>For many days nothing was talked of but the storm
and the wreck. And every day brought in news of some
disaster that had been wrought by the tempest.</p>

<hr class='c011'>

<p class='c010'>One day, as Alice sat sewing in her room, General
Garnet entered with a cloud upon his brow, and the
newly arrived Norfolk <i>Signal</i> in his hand. To his wife’s
startled look and anxious question, he answered:</p>

<p class='c010'>“A heavy misfortune has befallen our neighbor Hardcastle.
His son Lionel was lost in the storm of the
28th.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Heaven!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, fearful as the wind was here, it was even more
terrific farther down the coast. The <i>Falcon</i>, homeward
bound, was about entering Hampton Roads when overtaken
by that horrible and disastrous tempest. The <i>Falcon</i>
suffered frightfully. In the midst of the storm several
of the crew and one of the midshipmen were washed
overboard. Here is the full account in the leading column
of the <i>Signal</i>. Read it. I must go over and see
poor Hardcastle. By the way, Alice, this makes a very
great change in the prospects of your young friend,
Magnus. Hardcastle had no other child but Lionel, and
has no near relation but his nephew Magnus, has he?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>“No,” said Alice, looking surprised at such a question
at such a time.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hum-m-me! then, indeed, this ‘ill wind’ has blown
a great inheritance to Magnus. I suppose that after his
uncle has somewhat recovered the shock of his bereavement
he will recall Magnus. He will scarcely permit
him to pursue the study of medicine now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think that Magnus will prefer the study of some
profession. I am sure that he wishes to live an earnest
and useful life.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I do not know a more earnest purpose, or a
more useful life, than that lived through in the proper
administration of a large estate. By the way, Alice, I
hope you have not, with your usual indifference in all
things and to all persons, neglected to write to the poor
boy during his banishment among total strangers in
Baltimore?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I write to him every week.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is right; perfectly right. I am very glad to
hear it. Apropos, Alice, were not Magnus and Elsie very
great friends?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“They were very much attached to each other,” replied
Alice, with her innocent eyes still dilating with
wonder at these queries.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Very much attached to each other.’ Hum-m-me!
Mount Calm and Hemlock Hollow would form one very
magnificent estate, joining as they do—about ten thousand
acres, would they not be?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” said Alice abstractedly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, certainly, that is it. Let us see—how old is this
youth?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“About seventeen, I believe.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, and he will marry very early, if he can find a
wife to suit him. He will settle very soon to serious,
practical life. He is just the young man to do it. Alice,
when he returns I hope you will not permit him quite
to forget old friends. Stay—our Elsie is—twelve years
of age?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not quite.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, nearly twelve—then thirteen, fourteen, fifteen,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>sixteen—four years. Four years will quickly pass away;
and our young gentleman can wait that long. At the
end of four years I shall bring Elsie home from school.
She will then be sixteen years of age. You were but a
year older when you were married, Alice. Say, answer
me—you were but seventeen when you were married,
were you not?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I was but seventeen,” replied Alice.</p>

<p class='c010'>And here the conference ended.</p>

<p class='c010'>General Garnet found Mr. Hardcastle in the extremity
of grief. He had only received the dire intelligence of
the loss of his only and well-beloved son, in a letter of
condolence from the captain of the ship. He had nothing
new, therefore, to learn from General Garnet, but
thanked him for his visit and his sympathy. General
Garnet remained with him all day and until a late hour
of the night, when he took his leave.</p>

<p class='c010'>Days, weeks elapsed, before Mr. Hardcastle found
courage to summon Magnus to Hemlock Hollow, though
in the meantime Magnus had written often, expressing
his heartfelt sorrow and his earnest sympathy, and entreating
permission to come home and see his uncle. At
last Mr. Hardcastle wrote and recalled him. Magnus
came and remained over Christmas. Then, his uncle
being restored to his usual state of composure and cheerfulness,
and being engaged in his customary occupations
of agriculture and politics, hunting, fishing, and company,
Magnus begged leave to return to his studies.
His uncle opposed the proposition. What was the use of
his studying a profession now? Could he not be contented
to stay at home and keep a childless old man
company?</p>

<p class='c010'>But Magnus wished to be busy again.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, could he not be busy enough overseeing the
overseer, and keeping the plantation in order?” queried
the old man testily.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Magnus was very much in earnest, and persisted
in his purpose. Finally, the old man angrily threatened
to disown him, and let him go. And Magnus, preferring
his profession to any inheritance, departed.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>But let the reader rest assured that the old gentleman
had not the slightest intention of discarding the fine boy,
whom he loved as a second son.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Days and weeks passed on, and brought Christmas,
when an event occurred of so startling and inexplicable
a nature as to fill the whole neighborhood with wonder.</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Joe’s preparations for Christmas were all made,
with the exception of the turkey and the materials for
the plum-pudding. Miss Joe’s turkeys had all been
drowned in the great flood. Now, to have a roast turkey
and a plum-pudding at Christmas was Miss Joe’s eleventh
commandment of the Lord and fortieth article of the
Episcopal faith. So she took two pairs of men’s woolen
socks that she had just completed, donned her antiquated
bonnet and shawl, and, taking Pontius Pilate as
her negro body-servant, prepared to start for Huttontown
to exchange her work with the village shopkeeper
for raisins, currants, and spice, and money to purchase
a turkey. Snow clouds were slowly condensing in the
sky, but Miss Joe assured Agnes that she would be back
long before it came on to snow.</p>

<p class='c010'>And then, full of cheerful energy and anticipation, she
set out.</p>

<p class='c010'>Agnes remained in her usual apathetic mood, unheeding
the flight of time, until the sudden rising of the
wind and the sudden hustling of hail-stones against the
windows told her that a furious storm was coming up.
She arose and closed the window-shutters with some difficulty,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>and lighted a candle, when she found, to her surprise,
that it was already seven o’clock. It was high
time for Miss Joe to be at home. And now it occurred
to the kind heart of Agnes that the good old lady, coming
in from the storm, might relish a cup of hot tea. So
she threw more wood upon the fire (Miss Joe’s forethought
had supplied her with a pile of wood by the
chimney corner), and filled the tea-kettle and hung it
over the blaze. But Agnes knew that if Miss Joe did not
come almost immediately, if she had not already landed
on the island, she would not come that night. Agnes
set the table and made the tea.</p>

<p class='c010'>An hour passed by and Miss Joe had not returned,
and Agnes gave her up for the night.</p>

<p class='c010'>At about midnight the storm abated, the clouds broke
up, and a few stars looked shyly out as if reconnoitering
the darkness. The night was very dark. Agnes, who
felt lonely and nervous, and could not sleep, opened the
window-shutters to look out, but could scarcely discern
the line where the dark waters met the snow-covered
beach. The sky hung like a black pall over the island.
The deep darkness, the deep silence, the deep solitude
oppressed her with gloom and fear. Her form was
shrunk, and her eyes dilated by terror.</p>

<p class='c010'>Suddenly, while she gazed, the whole scene was
brightly illuminated. Several torches blazed along the
beach, lighting up the whole line of coast, and revealing
the forms of three boats already landed, and the figures
of several men passing back and forth.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the same instant that Agnes perceived them, she
felt that she herself must have been seen in the strong
glare of the lighted window at which she sat.</p>

<p class='c010'>She started up with the wish to extinguish her candle,
when she saw several of the men with torches approaching
the house; and, overpowered with terror, she fell in
a swoon.</p>

<hr class='c011'>

<p class='c010'>In the meantime Miss Joe had very reluctantly been
detained at Huttontown by the utter impossibility of
getting through the snowstorm to the isle. She had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>passed the night with Mr. Fig’s—the grocer’s—family,
bemoaning the necessity, and lamenting that “that poor
young thing would feel so lonesome, staying by herself
on the island all night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Very “bright and early” the next morning Miss Joe,
with a fine fat hen-turkey, living, and tied by the legs,
and several packages of raisins, currants, and spices, entered
her boat and set out on her return home.</p>

<p class='c010'>When she reached the lodge the scene of confusion
that met her eyes nearly transfixed her. Both doors,
front and back, were wide open, and the air was rushing
through the room. The fire had gone out; the great logs
of wood had burned in two and fallen apart, and the
charred and blackened ends were sticking up. The candle
had expired in melted grease, which was now spread,
cold, all over the candlestick, and down upon the nice
white-oak table. The bed had not been slept in, for
there it was perfectly smooth as Miss Joe had left it,
with her own peculiar folds and twists about it. And
there lay the baby in the cradle, screaming its little life
away.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the name o’ God A’mighty, Pont, what has been
a-happening?” asked Miss Joe, lifting up the child, and
sinking with it into a chair, pale as death.</p>

<p class='c010'>Pontius Pilate stood there with the screeching and
struggling turkey in one hand and the bundle of groceries
in the other—looking like a statue of dismay,
carved in ebony.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the name of Heaven, Pont, what has been a-takin’
place?” repeated Miss Joe.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gor A’mighty knows, mist’ess; but I does werily
b’lieve how de Britishers is been landen’ ag’in, or else
Bonnypart. Chris’ de Lor’ be praised, ole mist’, dat I
an’ you wa’nt home when dey come. See, now, how
ebery ting turn out for de bes’. S’pose dat snowstorm
hadn’t a come up, where you an’ I been? Good Lor’!
poor Miss Aggy! Wonder what’s come o’ her?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, what, my Lord! Pont,” said Miss Joe, who
never in any emergency was known to neglect the plain
practical duty of the moment, “go and get the tinderbox,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>and light a fire quickly, and heat some milk and
water for this child. He is almost frozen and almost
starved.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And Pontius Pilate put down his burdens and did as
he was bid. And Miss Joe made the infant perfectly
comfortable, and put him to sleep, before she joined
Pont in his vain search around the island for Agnes, or
some clew to her fate.</p>

<p class='c010'>When she ascertained that Agnes was certainly not on
the island, she dispatched Pontius Pilate to the mainland
to rouse up the people of Huttontown to prosecute
the search.</p>

<p class='c010'>And the people were aroused indeed to a state of nine
days’ wonder.</p>

<p class='c010'>What could have become of her? How could she have
left her sea-girt isle without a boat? Would she have
forsaken her child at all?</p>

<p class='c010'>No; Miss Joe was certain she would not; she was too
fond of him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Had she possibly drowned herself?</p>

<p class='c010'>No; Miss Joe was sure not; she was too much afraid
of dying and leaving her babe.</p>

<p class='c010'>Had she been carried off, then? and by whom?</p>

<p class='c010'>Yes. It was finally concluded that she must have been
carried off; but by whom? That was still the problem
unsolved. Inquiries were made up and down the coast
and in every direction. Advertisements were inserted
in the papers, and large rewards offered for her discovery
by General Garnet, Judge Wylie, and other benevolent
neighbors. For to this sort of assistance Miss Joe
made no objection. She considered the recovery of Agnes
quite an affair of general interest, as indeed it was.
Nothing, however, was heard of her.</p>

<p class='c010'>As months passed, the mystery deepened, and people
grew weary of conjecture.</p>

<p class='c009'>For a time Miss Joe had grieved immoderately over
the untimely and mysterious fate of her niece, and the
loneliness of her own lot, and the prospect of a poor and
solitary old age before her; but soon, in the native kindness
and disinterestedness of her heart, she turned to the
child thus thrown upon her exclusive protection, and
only hoped that she might be spared long enough to
raise him, and see him able to take his own part; for,
after all, small and helpless, and abandoned as he was,
he was the last Hutton of the Isles, and the heir of—the
little sand bank in the bay, yclept St. Clara’s Isle or
Hutton’s Isle.</p>

<p class='c010'>Very strange was the lot and life of the lonely recluse
of the sea-girt isle and her little protégé. Their only
possessions were the nearly barren islet, the dilapidated
lodge, a cow, a sheep or two, a little poultry and a dog.
No cart or horse had they, nor even any use for either.
The small skiff conveyed them to the mainland whenever,
for the purpose of laying in a few groceries or dry
goods, or of attending divine service, they found it
necessary or agreeable to go. Their faithful old servant,
Pontius Pilate, whose duty it was to till the land, row
the boat, fish the weir, rake the oyster bed, and cut and
bring wood from the mainland, was their only companion.
The soil immediately around the house being mixed
with clay and marl, still yielded, with careful cultivation,
corn and wheat enough for the small consumption of
the little family. And Pontius Pilate saved money by
grinding this in a hand-mill. The little garden produced
vegetables enough for their table. And the two sheep
yielded wool enough for their winter socks and mits—carded,
spun, and woven by the indefatigable fingers of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>Miss Joe. And so time passed on, until Miss Joe, not
having trouble enough on her hands already, was induced
to assume the responsibility of rearing another
child, a little wild elf-like girl, whose advent was almost
as great a subject of gossiping speculation as the disappearance
of Agnes had been. And the name of this
elfin child was Garnet Seabright.</p>

<p class='c010'>The history of Garnet Seabright, as it was understood
in the neighborhood, was very briefly this:</p>

<p class='c010'>When Hugh was about six years of age Miss Joe
received a letter from a distant relation living in Calvert
County, beseeching her, for the Redeemer’s sake,
to lose no time in hastening to the sick-bed of the writer,
who was most anxious to see her before she died.</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Joe had to rub her organ of eventuality before
she could recognize in the writer a cousin, a wild young
girl of exceeding beauty and willfulness, who had, years
before, eloped with a soldier, a certain George Seabright,
a distant relation of Captain Seabright.</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Joe never slighted any appeal to her benevolence.
She shut up house, left the island in care of Pontius
Pilate, took Hugh to Huttontown and left him in charge
of Mrs. Fig, the grocer’s wife, borrowed a mule, and set
out for Calvert County.</p>

<p class='c010'>The house of her cousin she heard upon inquiry was
a miserably poor cottage, with scarcely any cleared
ground around it, and situated in the midst of a deep,
dark forest. It was approached for miles only by a narrow
bridle path. It was near nightfall when Miss Joe
entered this lonesome path; it was quite dark before she
got near the house.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, good Lord! this is a great deal more lonesomer
and more wilder than my sea-girt island they make such
a fuss about; for there, at least, I could see an enemy a
long ways off. But here! Lord, there might be an Injun,
or a bandit, or more likely still, a runaway nigger,
behind every tree. Get up, Jinny! Hark! Lord deliver
us! what was that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Highe! cheep! th-sh-sh-e-e-e-e!”
laughed, screamed, chirped, chirruped a sharp,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>shrill voice, high up in the trees, or somewhere between
them and the blinking stars.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Lord save us, what was that?” ejaculated Miss Joe,
looking up at the branches overhead, in the direction of
the eerie voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>And there she saw, in the dark, bright starlight, in the
highest branches of the trees, among the green and glistening
leaves, a little elfin face, with glittering eyes, and
gleaming teeth and streaming hair, mopping and mowing
at her—chattering, gibing, laughing, and screaming
at her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“St. John and all the Holy Evangelists! St. Mary
and all the Holy Virgins!—what’s that? It’s—it’s—a
fairy—it’s—it’s—a brownie!” exclaimed Miss Joe, bursting
out into a profuse perspiration.</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Joe was neither cowardly nor superstitious, yet
when the little elf, with its wild eyes and streaming hair,
glided down the tree with the swiftness and celerity of
a monkey down a mainmast, and leaped, with a yell of
malice and delight, upon the mule, behind her, Miss Joe
opened her throat with a prolonged shriek, that might
have waked the dead.</p>

<p class='c010'>And at the same time the mule dashed, plunging and
kicking, forward.</p>

<p class='c010'>The elf stuck its little hands into Miss Joe’s fat sides,
and, as the good lady herself afterward said, clung there
like a craw-fish or a crab. The mule plunged madly on.</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Joe, delirious with terrors, real and imaginary,
lost all power of controlling the animal, dropped the reins,
and must have fallen off, had not the bit been seized by a
strong hand, and the mule forced back upon her haunches.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s Godfather!” cried the elf, in human words
and tones, and Miss Joe, looking up, recognized in her
deliverer General Garnet.</p>

<p class='c010'>The sprite leaped from the saddle to the bosom of
General Garnet, and clung there in her crab-like fashion,
her little head rubbed, rooted, under his chin, her little
arms around his neck, and her little figure almost veiled
by her long hair, screaming with her inarticulate tones
of affection and delight.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>Miss Joe dismounted from the now stationary mule,
and began in an eager voice to pour forth her surprise,
gratitude, and wonder.</p>

<p class='c010'>General Garnet, with a look of vexation, tinged with
amusement, tried to shake off his little encumbrance.
But it was like trying to get rid of a chestnut burr; for
if he succeeded in pulling her off from one place, she
would stick at another, screaming with wild delight and
elfish perversity, clinging to him, rooting her little head
into him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come, Netty! Come, come! this will not do; release
me. Goodness, child, are your hands and feet furnished
with claws?” exclaimed General Garnet, trying to tear
off the little human bramble.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Chip! Chip! Chee-ee-ee! H-sh-sh-sh! Whip!”</p>

<p class='c010'>It is impossible to convey in words the saucy, defiant,
chirping, inarticulate cry of the sprite, as it rammed
its head again into the bosom of its victim. Presently
the elf sprang away of itself, and perched upon the back
of the mule.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How is your mother, Netty?” then asked General
Garnet.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Waiting for you and the old woman, too. She sent
me after you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And now Miss Joe and the general looked at each
other in astonishment, as if mutually inquiring, “You,
too?”</p>

<p class='c010'>General Garnet, putting his hand upon the shoulder
of the elf, and giving her a slight shake, put her upon
the ground, took her hand, and walked up to the dark
forest path, drawing her after him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Joe took the bridle, and leading her mule, followed.</p>

<p class='c010'>A little way up the path was a horse standing perfectly
still, saddled and bridled, and with a portmanteau
on the crupper.</p>

<p class='c010'>General Garnet remounted this horse, and, taking the
wood-sprite before him, rode on up the path.</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Joe, not wishing to be left behind, tumbled up
into her old saddle, and urged old Jenny to her best
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>speed. They soon came to a little clearing in the forest,
and paused before the humble door of a log house. The
elf sprang down from her seat, and, darting into the
door, cried:</p>

<p class='c010'>“They’ve come, Minny! Godfather and the old
body, both.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Poke up the fire, and let them both come in, Netty!”
was the answer; and presently the sprite pulled open
the door with a bang, and stood there with her glittering
eyes and streaming hair and naked legs, to admit them.</p>

<p class='c010'>They entered and found the room occupied by two
persons; a young woman, who sat propped up in an
armchair by the fire; and an old negress, who seemed
to be her servant or nurse. The young woman bore a
singular resemblance to the elf-like child; but her dark
eyes were burning, and her face was bathed with the
fatal fires of consumption. She held out an emaciated
hand to welcome her visitors, while the old negress set
rude stools for their accommodation. The young invalid,
pressing the hand of Miss Joe, thanked her many
times for her kindness in taking this journey, and
begged her to sit down quite close to her, for that she
could not raise her voice much. Miss Joe drew the stool
to the side of the invalid and begged to be informed how
she could serve her, expressing at the same time her
perfect willingness to do so. Then the young woman, in a
feeble voice, interrupted by frequent fits of coughing,
said that she felt she had but little time to live,—that her
days, nay, her very hours were numbered,—that after
her death she wished Miss Joe to take charge of her
orphan child; that General Garnet, who considered himself
under great obligations to her late husband, would be
at the costs of its rearing and education, and would, besides,
liberally repay Miss Joe for the trouble she might
be put to in taking care of it.</p>

<p class='c010'>General Garnet was there to indorse her promises.
He approached them; and taking the feverish hand of
the invalid, and turning to Miss Joe, said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“The husband of this young woman was a soldier
under my command; he fought under me during the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>whole course of the war. Once he saved me from death.
Once he saved me from dishonor. He received his
death-wound—for, years after, it caused his death—in
the same battle in which I won my present military rank.
I am under eternal obligations to him; and while I have
an acre of ground, or a dollar at my banker’s, I will
never see this child want!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The invalid died the next morning, immediately after
being placed in her chair, where she had insisted upon
sitting.</p>

<p class='c010'>General Garnet arrived within an hour after, and took
the direction of the humble funeral.</p>

<p class='c010'>Within four days from this Miss Joe found herself
at home with her grandnephew, little Hugh, her ward,
Garnet Seabright, the old negress, who had fallen to
little Garnet’s possession, along with the personal effects
of her mother, and, lastly, with old Pontius Pilate, who
had complained of great loneliness during his mistress’
absence.</p>

<p class='c010'>Little Hugh Hutton was a proud and happy little man
the day of Netty’s arrival. He tried to multiply himself
into a train of attendants to wait upon the little girl.
He first proposed to give up his cot bed, his chair, and
his little chest for her use. He brought her all his playthings,
his bows and arrows, and guns and traps, and
hammered all day at what he fondly supposed to be a
boat, that he was making for her benefit.</p>

<p class='c010'>When General Garnet had taken leave of Miss Joe at
Huttontown, just as she was about to cross over to her
island, he had begged her to apply to him in any emergency,
and to call on him for anything her young charge
might want. The child of the soldier who had served
under him throughout the Revolutionary war, who had
once interposed his body to save his life, should never
suffer for the necessaries or comforts of existence while
that life was spared. And this he had said with that
earnest and fervent tone, and with that benign and beautiful
smile that never failed to fascinate the love and
trust of all who heard and saw him. And Miss Joe felt
assured and comfortable.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>But now, as days slid into weeks, and weeks grew into
months, Miss Joe heard no more of General Garnet and
his promises, nor did she like to take him at his word
and apply to him. He ought to prevent that and save
her feelings, she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>As years passed away, however, Miss Joe occasionally
wrote to General Garnet in behalf of her little protégée.
For the most part, her letters would remain unanswered,
but when one did elicit a reply, General Garnet’s epistle
would be full of kindness, blessing, encouragement, good
advice, and—nothing else.</p>

<p class='c010'>At last, during a bitter winter, their main dependence,
their faithful servant, poor old Pontius Pilate,
caught the pleurisy and died. In the midst of this trouble
Miss Joe wrote again to General Garnet, and once
more, and for the last time, invoked his promised assistance.
After the lapse of several days she received a
letter from the benignant general, full of condolence,
sympathy, and exhortation to hope and patience, and—nothing
else! The letter concluded with the assurance
that she had nothing to fear—that God never made a
mouth for which he had not also provided food. To
this letter the long-suffering old lady was exasperated
to reply—that though it was true God had made both
the mouths and the food, yet the mouths had fallen to
her lot, and the food to his.</p>

<p class='c010'>The general never replied to this last letter, and here
the correspondence ceased.</p>

      <div class='line in32'><i>—Willis.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>General Garnet was certainly not a parsimonious
man; perhaps his interest in his little godchild had died
with her mother; perchance, being a very wealthy man,
he could not appreciate the strait to which poor Miss
Joe and her little family were reduced; possibly, he did
not wish to give his personal attention to little Garnet’s
necessities; probably, he intended that Miss Joe should
get what was needed at the village store, upon his account;
certainly, if Miss Joe had liberally interpreted his
letters, and done so, he would, without demur, have settled
the bill. But Miss Joe was far too cautious to put
a doubtful construction on his letters, and run in debt.
I never clearly comprehended the difficulty between
them, but I believe they each misunderstood the other,
and so General Garnet remained with the stigma of
cruelty and ingratitude resting upon him, when, perhaps,
he could be justly accused of indifference only.</p>

<p class='c010'>Just about the time of Miss Joe’s last application also,
General Garnet, like Martha, was troubled with many
things. He was a candidate for the Senate, and all his
thoughts engaged in the secret, intriguing, vexatious,
multifarious business of electioneering; or if he had a
thought or a moment to spare, it was divided between
the negotiation with his neighbor, Mr. Hardcastle, of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>marriage between Magnus Hardcastle and Elsie Garnet,
or in preparations for the return of his daughter—having
his house repapered, repainted, and newly furnished.</p>

<p class='c010'>Magnus Hardcastle had obtained his diploma, and was
getting into some little practice, despite the grumbling,
growling, and swearing objections of his uncle, who
could see no necessity for his nephew “making a slave
of himself for nothing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Yes, absolutely for nothing! Let Magnus show a dollar
that he had ever earned by all his practicing of medicine.
Let him show even a dollar that he had ever got
back for the medicines that he had dispensed along with
his attention and advice!</p>

<p class='c010'>It was true, Magnus’ receipt-book, if he owned one,
was an unwritten volume. His practice was mostly
among poor people, who had no dollars to spare.</p>

<p class='c010'>Well, then, what did he do it for? What good did it
do him? There he was, rapped up out of his warm bed
in the middle of the winter’s night, in the midst of a
snowstorm, to ride five or six miles to some old woman
in a cramp colic, or some child with the croup! What
good did it do? And this was not the case once or
twice, but five or six times in a month. And what good
did it do him?</p>

<p class='c010'>Lives were saved!</p>

<p class='c010'>Yes, but what did he get for his trouble? Thanks,
maybe. Pooh! he knew very well that half the time he
got nothing but ingratitude and coarse abuse. He had
better remember that Irishwoman, with an inflammatory
fever, who took her powders every hour in a gill of
whisky, and, being near death, swore the d—— doctor’s
stuff had murdered her. He had better remember how
the other woman cursed him for cutting off her husband’s
mortified leg to the saving of his life. Pooh!
Let him give up the dirty profession. He did not adopt
him, did not intend to give him a fortune for the sole
purpose of enabling him to be a poor doctor without even
parish pay!</p>

<p class='c010'>Sometimes Magnus would answer to this effect:</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>“Nonsense, my good uncle! If I can do any good in
my day and generation, let me do it. Though I do sometimes
get abuse from some poor, ignorant man, or, more
frequently, a blowing up from some poor, nervous, overtasked
woman, who, by the way, would defend me, to
the death, the very next hour, if anyone else attacked
me—why should I care? I am quite as well liked as I
deserve to be. Most people are, in fact. Some day the
people around here will send me to Congress in my own
despite, I am so popular.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Send you to Congress! I expected that—I was only
waiting for that. It only wanted that to complete my
despair and your ruin.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dear uncle, be easy—I shan’t go,” Magnus would reply,
laughing.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yes, Dr. Magnus Hardcastle was very popular, and
could have carried as many votes as any man in the
county. He was the constant companion of General Garnet,
by what sort of attraction and association the reader
cannot fail to know. Never was such a zealous partisan
as Magnus! Never was such a stump orator,—earnest,
eloquent, impassioned, large-souled, great-hearted,
full of human sympathies,—he could sway a crowd to
and fro in a manner that might have been amusing, if
it had not been sublime in its exhibition of power. It
was his personal appearance, as well as his temperament,
that was the cause of much of this power over others.</p>

<p class='c010'>But it is time to give you some idea of Magnus Hardcastle
at twenty-three. He was a fine illustration of the
beauty of the vital system. He had the tall, athletic
form that distinguishes the men of the Western Shore;
a face rather square, by reason of the massive forehead
and massive jaws, both indicating intellect and strength;
but it was in the fullness of the beautifully rounded chin
and cheeks, in the fullness of the large, but beautifully
curved lips, that the fine, genial serenity, and joyous temperament
was revealed; the line of the nose and forehead
was nearly straight, and the eyes were clear blue,
the complexion was clear and ruddy; and the face was
surrounded by the darkest chestnut hair, and whiskers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>that met beneath the chin. The prevailing expression
of this fine countenance was confidence and cheerfulness.</p>

<p class='c010'>Magnus had been corresponding with Elsie for the
last three years, and looked forward to her return with
more of joyful anticipation than anyone else in the
world, perhaps, except her mother. A year before this,
two miniature portraits of Elsie, in her young womanhood,
had been forwarded from England. One of them
had been retained by her mother; the other was presented
by General Garnet to Magnus. He wore it in
his—vest pocket. It was his charm, his talisman, his
abracadabra. When, if ever, he would become, for the
instant, lazy, stupid, hopeless, or impatient, he would take
that miniature out, touch the spring so that the case
would fly open, and gaze upon that handsome, wholesome,
happy face until energy, inspiration, hope, and
patience came again; and he would close it, and replace
it in his pocket with a joyous faith in his coming
life, that not all the powers of evil could have shaken.</p>

<p class='c010'>I told you that Magnus was the zealous, active, and
most efficient partisan of General Garnet; he was also
the dear friend and confidant of Mrs. Garnet. Many
and long were the confidential talks they would have in
Alice’s dressing room; and the subject of these conversations
was Elsie—still Elsie.</p>

<p class='c010'>One day, after reading with Mrs. Garnet Elsie’s last
delightful letter, and discussing with her Elsie’s expected
arrival, he exclaimed joyfully: “This makes me gladdest
of all!—that our fresh, dewy, charming Elsie will
come at once to us. Well!—at once to me—that she
will not have had, as most young ladies have, many
other lovers; that the sun of the world will not have
stolen the bloom and the dew from our beautiful Maryland
rose.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But Magnus “reckoned” his future without destiny,
his “host.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Elsie had been withdrawn from school, indeed, and
was quite ready and anxious to get home. She was to
return with General A——’s family, who were soon expected
to sail for the United States. But one circumstance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>following another, and connected with his diplomatic
business, had deferred his departure from time
to time, until six months passed away—during which
time Miss Garnet had been presented at court, and was
moving in the best society in London. Yes; and, though
still impatient to come home, enjoying her happy self to
the utmost, as every letter testified.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now, you would think that after having congratulated
himself so upon the unsunned freshness of this
beautiful Maryland rose, that Magnus would lament that
she was blooming in the very blaze of the sun of fashion,
in the very conservatory of a court.</p>

<p class='c010'>By no means; her letters reassured him, every one.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is well, very well, upon the whole,” he said. “She
has now an opportunity of forming an acquaintance with
one order of society that may never occur again—of getting
an insight into one phase of human nature that
nothing but this experience could afford her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And time sped on, and brought the day when a letter
came to them, dated at Liverpool, and announcing that
General A——, with his family, and Miss Garnet, would
sail within a few days, in the ship <i>Amphytrite</i>, bound
from that port to Norfolk. Therefore, it was expected
that within a few days after, if not before the arrival of
the letter, the <i>Amphytrite</i> would be in port.</p>

<p class='c010'>General Garnet, accompanied by Dr. Hardcastle, left
Mount Calm immediately for Norfolk, to welcome his
daughter, if the ship had come; to wait for her if it had
not.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Garnet remained at home to receive her, in fond,
impatient expectation.</p>

<p class='c010'>She had Elsie’s bed chamber decorated, and a fire
made in it every day, and the parlors lighted and
warmed, and the tea table set for the whole party every
evening.</p>

<p class='c010'>At last, one night,—a week after they had left home,—while
she was standing before the parlor fire, trimming
a lamp on the chimney-piece, and wondering sadly if
she were not merely imagining that her long-lost daughter
was expected home, a carriage drove rapidly up the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>shaded avenue, steps were let down, people came, a little
bustle ensued, hasty steps and joyous voices were heard.
Alice ran out, and, in an instant, the mother, weeping,
laughing, exclaiming, had caught, and was hugging her
daughter laughing to her bosom. Yes, Elsie herself!—Elsie,
warm, alive, real, and such an armful of bright,
rosy, joyous life, and love and reality! I leave you to
imagine the joy of the party around the tea-table that
night, where all were too joyful to eat—or the late hour
at which they separated for the night and retired to their
several rooms, where each one was too happy to sleep.</p>

<p class='c010'>The next morning, happy, joyous Elsie had to hold
a sort of levee for the benefit of the colored folks. Every
negro in the house, or on the plantation, who had known
her before she went away, had to come and shake hands
with her, and welcome her back. And every little one
that had grown from infancy to childhood during her
absence, and to whom she was a sort of fabulous demigoddess,
or, it might be, one of the angels, had to come
and stare at her and be patted on the head, and get its
paper of sugar-plums or its toy.</p>

<p class='c010'>And then, later in the day, when her trunks and boxes
arrived in the wagon, and were unpacked, she had to
distribute her presents and tokens of remembrance to all
and each of the colored people.</p>

<p class='c010'>And in the course of the second day, when the news
of her arrival began to be rumored about, the companions
of her childhood, now grown up to be young men
and women, flocked in to see her. And it was from their
sly hints and innuendos that Elsie was taught that
it was expected of her father to give a ball, and that,
indeed, a great many people would be very greatly disappointed
if he did not. And good-natured Elsie, in order
to make so many young folks happy, named the matter
to her father, and begged him, as a personal favor
to herself, in consideration of her recent arrival home,
to give a party. So General Garnet, willing to please his
child, and believing, besides, that a large party might
forward his electioneering prospects, gave his consent.
He consulted Mrs. Garnet and Dr. Hardcastle, and fixed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>the time of the ball for that day two weeks. Magnus
was with Elsie every day. She perfectly understood,
though she could scarcely have told why, for no one
had as yet hinted the subject to her, that she was at no
very distant period of time to be married to Magnus.
She considered her marriage, like her leaving school,
her presentation at court, and her coming-out ball, a
part of the programme of her happy drama of life, and
was content. She loved Magnus. During her absence
in England, she had remembered and loved him as she
had remembered and loved her father and mother—as
one of the elements of her life’s joy.</p>

<p class='c010'>When she returned, she had met him with the fond
and free affection of a sister for an only brother.</p>

<p class='c010'>And when she had been at home a week, and Magnus
had found opportunity and courage, and led the beautiful
and happy girl to a shady nook in the twilight parlor,
and told her with the burning eloquence of passion
how long, how deeply, how greatly he had loved her;
how she had been at once his one memory and his one
hope—his incentive, his dream, his inspiration, his guiding
star, Elsie heard him with undisguised astonishment
at his earnestness and enthusiasm, and wondered to herself
where it all came from. And when he, full of doubt
and fear, for her free and unembarrassed manner discouraged
him, begged her to give him answer, she
replied, without the slightest hesitation or embarrassment—nay,
even in her native, gladsome, confident manner—that
he need not have given himself so much anxiety;
that of course everybody knew they were going
to be married; didn’t their lands join? and, of course,
she had never even thought of retreating.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now you may think from that speech that Elsie was
a sadly heartless and mercenary and calculating little
baggage. She was as far as possible from being that.
She was a fresh, innocent, totally inexperienced girl,
who repeated, parrot-like, the sentiments of those around
her.</p>

<p class='c010'>Magnus knew that, and caught her, strained her to his
bosom, pressed kisses on her brow, her cheeks, her lips,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>in the delirious joy of “first and passionate love.” And
Elsie broke from his arms and ran from the room suffused
with blushes, trembling with a strange, painful,
blissful tumult. All that evening Elsie wandered about
upstairs, or sat dreaming, half in terror, half in joy,
until her mother came in and asked of what she was
thinking so deeply?</p>

<p class='c010'>Elsie started, and blushed violently.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alice took both her hands and gazed deeply into her
face.</p>

<p class='c010'>At that earnest and tender mother’s gaze, the tears
sprung into Elsie’s eyes, and then, as struck by something
ludicrous in herself or her position, Elsie laughed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alice pressed her hands, and released them, saying:</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is time to dress, my dear Elsie, your father expects
you in the parlor. Let me fix your hair; it is in
sad disorder.” And she smoothed and twined the rich
ringlets around her fingers, letting them drop in long
tendrils of golden auburn.</p>

<p class='c010'>And then she arranged her dress of purple cashmere,
and they went below to the lighted parlor, where General
Garnet and Magnus awaited them. The general
and Magnus were engaged in a political discussion, but
Magnus broke off and came at once to meet them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Elsie, with a bright blush, turned away and walked to
a distant table, where she ensconced herself with her
tambour frame.</p>

<p class='c010'>But from that day Elsie gradually changed. She kept
out of the way of Magnus most sedulously. The courtship
became a regular hunt. All Magnus’ ingenuity was
employed in devising how he could circumvent Elsie’s
arch and saucy prudery, and entrap her into a little
lover’s talk or walk. And all Elsie’s tact was engaged in
devising means to avoid without offending Magnus.</p>

<p class='c010'>And so days went on, until one day it fell like ice upon
the warm heart of Magnus, that Elsie might not love him
except as a brother; and oh! he thought of her first, free,
fond, sisterly affection for him, until the evening upon
which he first declared his passion, and then of her calm
agreement to marry him because their lands joined, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>her cold avoidance of him ever since. “Yes,” he said to
himself, “it is too true. Elsie does not love me. I am
wooing an unwilling bride. Shall I continue to do so?
Shall I marry her and seal her misery? No, my God!
No, though she is the first and last hope of my life, I will
resign her if that will make her happy.” And so Magnus
suddenly abandoned the pursuit of Elsie, and grew
thoughtful, sorrowful, pale, and weary-looking.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then he absented himself from Mont Calm for several
days. Elsie did not grow pale or thin; she was too sanguine
for that; but she became uneasy, then anxious, then
restless, and would walk about looking silently from the
windows, particularly the back windows that overlooked
the forest road leading down to the Hollow; or looking
into her father’s or her mother’s face with an anxious,
appealing look of silent inquiry. If the door-bell were
rung, she would start violently, pause breathlessly, turn
very pale, ask eagerly of the servant who returned, “who
was that?” The answer, “Judge Jacky Wylie,” or
“Marse Roebuck” caused her to sink back in her
seat, disappointed and blushing with mortification. And
yet only two or three days had passed; but then Magnus
had been in the habit of coming twice a day, and
staying over night; and two or three days seems to a
young, impatient heart like two or three eternities.</p>

<p class='c010'>At last General Garnet, in the blackest rage and the
brightest smile, put a pair of pistols in his pocket,
mounted his magnificent black war-horse Death, and rode
down to Hemlock Hollow, with the deliberate intention
of courteously inquiring into Dr. Hardcastle’s motives of
conduct, and blowing his brains out if the answer should
not prove satisfactory. Not that he sympathized with
Elsie, or believed in broken hearts, but that he had a
saving faith in the junction of estates, and a high respect
for the “honor of his house.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He found Magnus looking sallow and haggard, and
immediately surmised that he had been ill, reproached
him in a polite, gentlemanly way for not having informed
his friends of his indisposition, and finally hoped
that he had recovered.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>Magnus pleaded guilty to illness, and much care and
anxiety, and spoke of the pain that enforced absence from
Elsie gave him. Not for the world would Magnus have
hinted that Elsie’s coldness had driven him away, and
that despair had made him ill; he knew too well that such
a communication would be visited with great severity by
her father upon the head of Elsie. And he judged
rightly—General Garnet’s heart was set on the marriage
of those two joining plantations. If Magnus had backed
out, he would have shot him like a dog. If Elsie had retreated,
he would have turned her out of doors. If both
had broken off, by mutual consent, he would have—Satan
only knows what he would not have done.</p>

<p class='c010'>As it was now, he was perfectly satisfied with Magnus,
insisted that he should come over the day of the ball,
if not before, received his promise to do so, and took
leave.</p>

      <div class='line'>But hush! hark!</div>
      <div class='line in46'><i>—Byron.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The day of the ball arrived. People had been invited
for twenty miles around. Apartments had been prepared
for the guests who, coming from a distance, would be
likely to remain all night. From an early hour in the
afternoon carriages began to arrive, and the men-servants
had enough to do in stabling the horses and putting
away the vehicles; while the maid-servants were employed
in showing the company to their dressing rooms,
and attending upon them there.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>Magnus came early in the afternoon, in order to have
a private conversation with Mrs. Garnet, to whom he intended
to open his heart fully.</p>

<p class='c010'>He asked for her as soon as he arrived, and was immediately
shown up into her bed chamber, into which
both Alice and her daughter had been crowded by the
incoming of their guests. As he entered, Alice came forward
with a smile to meet him. Elsie started violently,
colored brightly, and, ere anyone could prevent her, even
if they had wished, flew from the room.</p>

<p class='c010'>As she flew by him, Magnus fixed one passionate reproachful
look upon her, and said, in a hurried voice:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Fear nothing, Elsie! I will never trouble you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Alice, still smiling, pointed him to a chair. He sat
down, dropped his forehead upon his hands for a moment,
sighed heavily, looked up, and opened his story.
He told Alice that he had discovered, to his eternal sorrow,
that Elsie did not love him, that though to resign
her was like resigning his hope of heaven, yet every
principle of justice and honor obliged him to do so; he
concluded by asking her opinion as to the best manner
of breaking this affair to General Garnet, so as to shield
Elsie from his indignation.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And so you wish to give Elsie up?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wish!” and Magnus dropped his forehead into his
palms with a groan that might have started all the house,
had they been listening. Then, lifting his head up again,
he said sternly, almost fiercely:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Listen! If Elsie loved me, not all the power of earth
or of hell—or—God forgive me!—I had nearly said of
heaven—should sever her from me! not you—not her
father—not herself—if only she loved me! But she does
not, and it is all over.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And who told you she did not love you?” inquired
Alice, smiling at his vehemence, and sighing as her
thoughts flew back to the past, when she was resigned in
spite of herself. “Who told you that Elsie did not return
your love?”</p>

<p class='c010'>With a gesture of despair Magnus recounted all that
had passed between himself and Elsie, and ended, as he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>had begun, with a groan, dropping his head upon his
hands.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Puir human bodies are sic’ fules,</div>
      <div class='line'>Wi’ a’ their colleges and schules,</div>
      <div class='line'>That when nae real ills perplex ’em,</div>
      <div class='line'>They mak eno’ themsel’s to vex ’em,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>sang Alice; then said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Magnus! with all your knowledge—with your
classic, and mathematic, and philosophic, and metaphysic
learning—with all your knowledge, not to know a young
girl’s heart better than that! Oh, Magnus! ‘with all
your getting, get wisdom, get understanding.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Alice, Cousin Alice! Do you mean to intimate what
sometimes I have madly hoped—that I have been mistaken,
that Elsie does——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That Elsie loves you a thousandfold more now,
that she avoids you, than she did while she laughed,
and talked, and romped with you. Oh, man! you should
have found this out for yourself, and not have put me to
the shame of betraying my child. And now, never let me
hear another word of your self-sacrificing resignation of
Elsie’s hand, or I shall take you at your word, as she
would do now, for I don’t believe in it. I have more
faith in the cruelest demonstrations of a downright, honest,
sincere, human passion than in all the self-martyrizing
resignation in the world!” said Alice, with a
strange asperity, for her thoughts flew back again to the
past. “Go, Magnus! You will find Elsie in the ballroom.
Go, Magnus; I love you, or I never would have
said all that I have said to you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Magnus seized the hand of Alice, pressed it to his
heart, to his lips, and darted from the room in search of
his betrothed.</p>

<p class='c010'>He found her in the large saloon, described in the beginning
of this story as occupying the whole of the righthand
wing of the house. She was standing at a table, arranging
a large bouquet in a marble vase. He stole
softly up behind her, and, restraining the impetuous force
of his emotions, passed his arm gently around her waist,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>and drew her—so gently!—to his heart. And Elsie’s
head sank upon his shoulder. He raised her chin and
kissed her—still so gently!—as fearing to startle her shy
trust and again frighten her away. So gently, and
trembling all over, for in his bosom he held a young tornado
in check. At last she moved to withdraw herself
from his arms; he pressed her once more to his bosom,
printed one more kiss upon her lips, and let her go. So
quiet and so silent was their reconciliation.</p>

<p class='c010'>He stood there where she left him in a happy trance,
until the company began to drop in one by one, and in
couples, and trios, and in small parties.</p>

<p class='c010'>And then he wandered on by himself. He strolled
down the shaded avenue, and through the gate, and over
the burnished hills, now brown with the sear wind of
November, under the cold deep-blue starlit skies,
wrapped in a blissful dream, until the sudden peal of
music from the house awoke him.</p>

<p class='c010'>He turned to retrace his steps, and now saw the whole
south wing blazing with light, and the sprite-like figures
of the dancers as they flitted by the illuminated windows.
He hastened back, entered the house, hurried to the little
room always kept sacred to his use, arranged his toilet,
and went below.</p>

<p class='c010'>He entered the ballroom, which was resplendent and
joyous with light, and music, and gay and brilliant company.
Magnus slowly made his way through the crowd
in search of his ladylove, but nodding, smiling, shaking
hands, according to the degree of his acquaintance with
the individuals that made up the company.</p>

<p class='c010'>Judge Jacky was there in great force—superb in a
blue velvet coat, white satin vest, and smallclothes.</p>

<p class='c010'>And Ambrosia Wylie was there, too. Miss Ambush,
as the colored folk perverted her pretty name. Oh, well
named both ways, for she had grown up the most alluring
<i><span lang="la">ignis-fatuus</span></i> that ever drew men on an elf chase
through brambles and quagmires.</p>

<p class='c010'>She had already drawn General Garnet on to ask her
to dance! General Garnet, the proud, the stern, the majestic,
the unbendable, is actually bending over her with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>his most seraphic smile, and a gaze that might melt all
the icebergs in the Northern Ocean—and she has raised
her languishing eyes, with the look of a gratified angel,
and she has given her hand, and he, still shining upon her
with that sunlike smile, is leading her to the head of the
cotillion.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the meantime, Magnus found his ladylove. She
was sitting at the farthest extremity of the room, the
center of a circle of sprightly young people, who were
eagerly engaged in asking her questions concerning her
residence abroad, London, the court, the king, etc., etc.,
and as eagerly listening to her replies. As Magnus
gently broke through this circle, and approached her side,
with a smile, her eyes fell and her color rose.</p>

<p class='c010'>Her young friends, with a smile, a laugh, or an arch
glance, dropped off, one by one, leaving the lovers
alone.</p>

<p class='c010'>And now Elsie’s eyes were dropped to the ground, and
her color mounted to her temples.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the same moment a young gentleman came up and
asked the pleasure of her hand in the next quadrille.</p>

<p class='c010'>Elsie, with a start, and a sigh of relief, suffered him to
lead her forth to the head of the cotillion.</p>

<p class='c010'>I am sure Dr. Hardcastle was unconscious of the angry
flush and fierce glance with which he followed the meanderings
of the young couple through the mazes of the
dance.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not so Elsie. With many a swift, furtive glance she
detected the angry passion of her lover’s face, and felt
self-reproach enough to bewilder her movements. Never
had beautiful Elsie danced with less grace, and never had
she been so glad when the set was over.</p>

<p class='c010'>Her partner led her to a seat, distant from the one he
had taken her from, took his seat by the side of her, and
held her in conversation that made her more fidgety than
before.</p>

<p class='c010'>Poor Elsie was at length relieved by Judge Jacky, who,
seeing her distress and embarrassment, came up, and
taking my gentleman by the arm, and saying to him:
“There is a very lovely woman who would not be averse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>to dancing the next set with you; come, let me introduce
you to her,” marched him off to dance with a tall, thin
young lady of sixty-five.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dr. Hardcastle now left his position across the room,
and, walking leisurely, came up to Elsie, and dropped
slowly into the seat just vacated.</p>

<p class='c010'>And at that very instant, as if to try his patience to the
utmost, up came Ulysses Roebuck, and holding out his
hand, in quite a confident way, informed Elsie that he intended
to confer upon her the glory and the joy of being
his partner in the next set.</p>

<p class='c010'>Elsie glanced at Magnus, shook her head, and laughed
lightly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ulysses persisted, affirming that indeed he was in earnest,
and did not mean to humbug her; that he really had
reserved the honor and the pleasure of his hand in the
next cotillion for her, and her alone. That his uncle had
selected a very charming partner for him, whom he had
declined, in consideration of her.</p>

<p class='c010'>Elsie laughed a little, and told him she feared “the
honor and the pleasure” was only offered to her in
order to pique Ambrosia.</p>

<p class='c010'>Whereupon Roebuck began to vow and protest, but in
the midst of his vociferous asseverations, he happened to
spy Ambrosia sitting down, quite exhausted, quite alone,
apparently quite disengaged, for the first time during the
evening, and Ulysses suddenly sped off toward her, in
order to secure her at once—for the dance?—no, for a
good, rousing quarrel.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why did you not dance with Ulysses?” inquired
Magnus of Elsie.</p>

<p class='c010'>She threw a swift glance to his face, then dropped her
eyes, and replied, in a low tone:</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall not dance again to-night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why?” he asked, taking her hand, and seeming to
study its deep beauty. “Why will you not dance again
to-night?”</p>

<p class='c010'>But she colored so deeply, and looked so distressed,
that he desisted from questioning her.</p>

<p class='c010'>At last Elsie of herself said, in a very low voice:</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>“Mother told me not to dance, unless it were to make
up a set that could not otherwise be completed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I do not understand why you should have been
warned against your favorite amusement, Elsie?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, lest by filling up one place in the cotillion, I
might keep some young lady from dancing,” replied she.
But then, as though spurning disingenuousness, she
added: “But that was not the only reason I refused
Ulysses.” Then pausing, and making a great effort over
herself, she added, in a very low and tremulous voice:
“It was because you looked so annoyed while I was dancing
with Mr. Brent.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The light of an unutterable joy shone on the face of
Magnus. He caught her hand with a strong, almost
crushing clasp—his bosom heaved—his eyes kindled and
smoldered. He stooped his lips near Elsie’s ear to whisper
something, but her cheek blazed.</p>

<p class='c010'>And just then a slight bustle at the other extremity of
the room attracted their attention. Exclamations of astonishment,
joy, and wonder were intermingled with
many words of cordial greeting, and of hearty welcoming.
Above all noises were heard the jocund tones of
old Mr. Hardcastle. The bustle widened in the crowd,
like eddies in the water where a stone had just been
cast, and the crowd seemed to be swayed toward the
place where our lovers sat. The center of this crowd
was a young man of rather effeminate, but exceeding
personal beauty, tall, and slightly, but elegantly proportioned,
with Grecian features, a fair, roseate complexion,
golden hair, and light, soft, hazel eyes. He was receiving,
and gracefully and graciously acknowledging, the
<i><span lang="fr">devoirs</span></i> of all around him, who were also moving with
him towards Magnus and Elsie. As he drew near, they
both simultaneously exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c010'>“My Cousin Lionel!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Lionel Hardcastle!”</p>

<p class='c010'>And both eagerly started forward, holding out their
hands, in joyful welcome, before even thinking of the
miracle of his advent.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lionel at first shook hands with Magnus, then, seeming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>to yield to a sudden and irresistible impulse, folded
him to his heart in a close brotherly embrace.</p>

<p class='c010'>He then took Elsie’s hand, bowed over it gracefully,
raised it tenderly to his lips, when Elsie exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, my dear old playmate, I am so glad! so glad!
that you were not lost after all!” threw herself into his
arms.</p>

<p class='c010'>The youth’s eye and cheek kindled with a hectic flush,
as he pressed the innocent, affectionate girl for an instant
to his bosom, and released her to turn and see Magnus
grasp her arm with no very gentle hand, and lead her
away. To the many eager questions of “When did you
arrive?” “Where from?” “How did you escape?”
“Where have you been all this time?” put to him by the
astonished crowd as soon as they recovered sufficient
strength, Lionel replied:</p>

<p class='c010'>“To-morrow, to-morrow, I will tell you all about it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That you shan’t! you shan’t tell for a week. It is
enough, good Heaven, to have you among us. No more
questions shall be asked or answered for a week!” exclaimed
Judge Wylie, in a magisterial tone, and the company
understood that they had been wearying a fatigued
traveler, and desisted.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was late when the ball broke up. And Judge Jacky,
who seemed possessed with a spirit of jollity, resolved to
follow up this party by one of his own. Accordingly,
that very night, he improvised the “time, place, and circumstance”
of a ball, and availed himself of the opportunity
afforded by the presence of so many of his familiar
friends, to give out rather informal verbal invitations.
When all the company had departed, a cloud remained
upon the brow of General Garnet. He spoke
coldly to Magnus, in reply to his “good-night,” as the
latter left the house. Alice looked deeply distressed.
Elsie glanced from father to mother with a vague presentiment
of impending evil.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Magnus had returned home with his cousin. The
next day the family from the Hollow dined at Mount
Calm, by invitation. General Garnet was still cold and
reserved to Magnus, but showed the most marked attention
to Lionel. This at first surprised Dr. Hardcastle;
but soon, with a haughty curl of the lip, he thought:</p>

<p class='c010'>“I see how it is; fortune has changed. I have lost an
inheritance.”</p>

<p class='c010'>After dinner Lionel told a tale of an Algerine cruiser,
of a long captivity, of a hair-breadth escape, but left as
vague an impression of reality upon the minds of his
hearers as it leaves now upon the minds of my readers.
They did not doubt his story, but they could not well connect
the effeminate beauty of the man with any life of
pirate-adventure and slavery hardships.</p>

<p class='c010'>Elsie was saddened for the first time in her life, and
she scarcely knew wherefore. During the short estrangement
between herself and her lover she had been nervous,
anxious, excitable; now she was depressed. She
loved her mother very tenderly; she loved her father passionately;
and Magnus she loved—oh, how shall I say?—with
an infinite future reservation. But now she saw
a cloud—she was too guileless to know wherefore—settle
and deepen, dark, cold, and chill, between her lover
and her father; and the happy, buoyant Elsie grew pensive
and thoughtful. General Garnet, with all his coldness,
was studiously polite; and Magnus was self-possessed
and social.</p>

<p class='c010'>As this day passed—as far as the relative positions of
some of the parties were concerned—so passed the
weeks, and brought the day upon which Judge Wylie’s
party was to be given.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>There was a heavy cloud of thought and care upon the
brow of General Garnet; and those who knew him well
surmised that he was considering the best manner of
transferring the hand of the heiress of Mount Calm from
the poor doctor to the rich heir of Hemlock Hollow.</p>

<p class='c010'>Magnus continued his visits, as usual, undisturbed by
the freezing exterior of General Garnet.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alice always received him with affection; and Elsie’s
manner to him was earnest, affectionate, deferential, as if
she wished to make up for her father’s coldness. She
was no longer shy and diffident. It seemed as if the
presentiment of some impending misfortune, which
she felt rather than understood, had thrown down the
barriers of her reserve, and that she could not do too
much, in her sweet, feminine way, to assure Magnus of
her unchangeable affection and unswerving truth. Her
eyes waited on him, shyly, all day long, for her maiden
pride was self-subdued, but not her maidenly delicacy.
Elsie had no suspicion of what her father really meant
until the morning of the day upon which Judge Wylie’s
ball was to be given. General Garnet called Elsie into
his room, and having explained in his polite way—he
was polite even to his child—that circumstances beyond
all human calculation or control had rendered it expedient
that a new adjustment of affairs should take place,
and that she must no longer look upon Magnus Hardcastle
in the light of a suitor for her hand, but must, on
the contrary, prepare herself to think of, and accept,
Lionel Hardcastle, to whom he had given permission to
visit her—Elsie opened wide her eyes in undisguised
astonishment, that her father, her revered father, should
ask her to break her plighted faith; but without one atom
of terror, and without an instant’s hesitation, she answered:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, father, being engaged to Magnus, with yours
and mother’s consent, I would no more forsake him now
than if I were already his wedded wife.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We shall see, Miss Garnet. I will give you time,”
replied the General, in his soft, but sarcastic, manner.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Father,” said Elsie, her cheek burning with shame
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>and indignation, “if I should give you to suppose that
any lapse of time could alter my determination, I should
be a coward or a hypocrite. Father, I would not have
engaged myself without your consent and my mother’s,
for I should have felt that to be wrong; but having engaged
myself with your consent and blessing, I will not
break that engagement, come what may. I promised, with
your approbation, to give my hand to Dr. Hardcastle on
Thursday week, and Thursday week, father, I must do
it. Dr. Hardcastle has lost an inheritance; an event
which he rejoices in, since it gives his uncle back a
dearly beloved and long-lost son. But he must not lose
his wife, father; he shall not.”</p>

<p class='c010'>General Garnet stood like one thunderstruck. His wife
had never ventured to oppose his will, except</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“To plead, lament, and sue,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>to avert some cruel deed. His servants had ever trembled
before him. His very neighbors and associates had
fallen into the habit of yielding to his inflexible will;
and here was a little girl of seventeen years of age, with
positively her own notions of right and wrong, of faith
and infidelity, of honor and dishonor—and telling him,
with a high, unblanching cheek, and a clear, unfaltering
voice, that she meant to abide by right, and eschew
wrong! He turned pale with suppressed rage; his eyes
gleamed with their sinister light; he clenched his fist,
and made one step towards her, but retreated again, and
dropped his hand. The polished “gentleman” asserted
its supremacy of habit over the angry “man.” It would
not be <i><span lang="fr">comme-il-faut</span></i> for “General Garnet” to give
“Miss Garnet” a good drubbing with his fists; besides,
there was a look of calm, healthful moral strength about
the mere child that forcibly impressed him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Father, this thing came suddenly upon me, and surprised
me out of my self-possession, and the respect that
is due to you. I spoke hastily, and, I fear, irreverently.
I earnestly repent it, and ask your pardon. Forgive
me,” said Elsie; and she approached, and would have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>offered herself in his embrace; but General Garnet extended
his hand, and waved her off.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do I understand you to say, Miss Garnet, that you
repent your foolish decision? If so, I am sincerely rejoiced
to hear it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, sir. Always, father, and in all else, I will be
your submissive child. But for this, sir, you, yourself,
laid on me this other duty, which I cannot shake off.
Forgive me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>General Garnet looked at her steadily, while gleamed
that red light from his dark eyes, and slowly shook his
head, as communing with himself. Then, turning suddenly,
and muttering something that sounded very much
like a threat to “break her will or break her heart,” he
left the room; and Elsie sank down in her chair, and
leaning upon the windowsill, raised her eyes to heaven,
“full of thought and prayer.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XIX.<br> <span class='large'>THE DEVOTION OF LOVE.</span></h2>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Oh! sweeter far than wealth, than fame, than all,</div>
      <div class='line'>Is first and passionate love; it stands alone.</div>
      <div class='line in46'><i>—Byron.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>There was a much larger, but not so select, a company
invited by the genial, social Judge Jacky than that assembled
by the proud and reserved General Garnet. And
by “early candle light”—the country hour for assembling
for a ball—the whole house—parlors, chambers,
family rooms, and saloon—were crowded to overflowing.
The dining room only was kept shut up, for there the
two long tables were to be set for supper. The saloon,
or “big room,” as it is plainly called in old-fashioned
country houses, was blazing with light and splendor, and
pealing with music, and alive with young men and maidens
in ball dresses, laughing, talking, wooing, flirting,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>dancing. It was something like General Garnet’s ball
on a larger and somewhat coarser scale, it must be confessed,
but then it was such a joyous, jubilant, exultant
scene! The young folks laughed, and talked, and
danced, and jested with so much gladness and freedom!
And Judge Jacky moved about laughing, talking, joking,
gallanting all the ugly old maids, making love to all the
low-spirited old widows, flattering and complimenting
all the plain girls, encouraging all shamefaced young
gentlemen, and electrifying into jocund life all the “flat,
stale, and unprofitable” folks in the joyous company.</p>

<p class='c010'>But it is not with the gay and thoughtless of that
merry throng that we have to do, but with our great-hearted
Magnus and our dear Elsie. You know at this
moment, just as well as I do, that they both had too much
on their minds to think of dancing. They had each come
to the ball chiefly to meet the other and have a talk.
General Garnet would willingly have kept Elsie away,
but he did not think it polite to offend Judge Wylie by
doing so. But one thing he had taken care to do—to
send for Lionel Hardcastle to escort her there. And
Lionel had ridden in the carriage alone with Elsie from
Mount Calm to Point Pleasant, and had had every opportunity
of pursuing a courtship that he had commenced
almost from the first evening of his return. Elsie cut
him short in the midst of one of his finest speeches by
telling him that he was making love to his cousin’s wife—or
to one who would be so on Thursday week! Yes,
Elsie compelled herself to say exactly that to Lionel, to
crush his hopes at once. On reaching the house at Point
Pleasant, Elsie said aloud to Magnus, who came out to
meet them:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dr. Hardcastle, help me to thank your cousin for
the kind manner in which he has supplied your place in
attending me here,” and, bowing courteously to Lionel,
she took the arm of Magnus and entered the saloon.</p>

<p class='c010'>They were now seated at the farthest extremity of the
vast saloon, within the bay window. Elsie was looking
very beautiful this evening. She was dressed in a gossamer
white crape, over white satin. Her snowy arms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>and neck were bare, and encircled by diamond bracelets
and necklace. She was always beautiful, but now her
usually happy, joyous face was softened and deepened
into an expression of serious thought and feeling ineffably
charming.</p>

<p class='c010'>They had been conversing. Elsie had told him all that
had passed between herself and her father. And Magnus
had recounted a similar scene that had taken place
between himself and General Garnet. He had, as Elsie
had, asserted his determination to abide by their betrothal.
He repeated the same thing to Elsie now. It
was this—this saving of her heart’s fondest hopes amid
the crash of fortune—that made Elsie feel and look so
very blessed.</p>

<p class='c010'>They were still conversing. He raised her hand—she
had an exquisitely beautiful hand, elegantly shaped, and
white as snow, and now diamond rings sparkled upon it;
appropriate ornaments for it, as one may see. Well, he
raised that small, white, jeweled hand, and looking tenderly,
half-remorsefully upon it, said—and his voice was
full-toned and melodious with love and sorrow:</p>

<p class='c010'>“This tiny, snow-white hand, sparkling with diamonds—this
fresh, pure, delicate thing!—a jewel itself!—how
can it be put to the uses to which my wife’s hand
must be put, Elsie?”</p>

<p class='c010'>She looked at him with passionate devotion, saying:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Take the jewels off and cast them from thee, Magnus—do!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And this slender wrist—you have such a beautiful
arm, Elsie! What a round, full, graceful curve from
the elbow to the forearm, and how elegantly it tapers off
to the slender wrist! Ah! this arm, so pure and fresh,
so well decked with this sparkling diamond bracelet—like
icicles upon snow! How will it support labor?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The bracelet offends you, too? It was my father’s
birthday gift; but I like it no longer—it offends you.
Take it off and cast it from you. Press your thumb and
finger around my arm instead. Press it tightly, so that
you will leave a ring there. It will be a red bracelet—or
even a black one; so that when I can no longer see you,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>I may close my eyes, and, feeling the impress of your fingers,
cheat my heart with the fancy that you still grasp
my wrist with a sweet violence. It will be another dearer
bracelet that I will wear in remembrance of you. Oh,
don’t you know I understand now the enthusiasm of the
saints?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dearest Elsie, let us go forth from here. The light,
the glare, the crowd, the noise here is insufferable. Let us
go forth in the fresh air under the light of the holy stars.
Come, love! My heart hungers, faints, to press you to
itself. Come, love!” And opening a leaf of the bay
window, he led her forth. It was a mild, clear, beautiful
starlight night for the season, yet the air was chill, and
Elsie was lightly clad. He looked at her and glanced
around. The lighted window of a sitting room in the
angle of the building showed that apartment to be vacant.
He led her there. It was one of those small, conical
wainscoted parlors so common in old houses. A fine fire
was burning in the chimney, and a little old-fashioned
green settee drawn up on one side of the fireplace. The
room had an air of delightful snugness, comfort, and repose.
He led her to this sofa and seated himself beside
her, opened his arms, and whispered: “Come to my
bosom, my own soul’s love!” and folded her closely
there. “Elsie, my pure, fresh, delicate, elegant Elsie,
can you go with me indeed to share my lot of poverty and
struggle? Oh, Elsie! if you do, will you never repent?
Oh, Elsie! do you know what poverty is? Born and
brought up in luxury and wealth, do you know what poverty
is? Oh, Elsie, my little idealist, there is no poetry
in poverty. Oh, Elsie, my little epicurienne, every sense
is shocked and tortured in poverty. You see unsightly
things, you hear discordant sounds, you come in contact
with roughness, you partake of coarse food; oh, Elsie!
ideality is wounded and saddened, sense is shocked, and
love itself, perhaps, revolted!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Never! oh, never!” she said fervently.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Elsie! my bright, beautiful Elsie! my delicate,
elegant Elsie! I am worse than an executioner to marry
you. I feel it, and yet I shall do it. God knows that I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>will have you, and let the future take care of itself!” he
said, pressing her strongly to his bosom.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, have me, have me; let me be always with you.
It will be bliss ineffable. I should die if you were to
leave me. My heart would consume itself in its own
fires. I do not care for wealth, or rank, or distinction,
or for ease or luxury. I only care for the wealth and
luxury of your affection, and your constant society. I
do not fear to have ‘ideality wounded and saddened.’
No, for the soul creates its own poetry. I do not fear
to have every sense shocked. I do not fear to live amid
unsightly objects and discordant sounds, and rough contacts;
oh, no, for the soul creates its own heaven of
beauty and harmony. I do not fear to have love revolted.
Oh! no, no, no! I only fear a separation from
you. My whole being trembling, tends toward you—so
strong, as it would lose itself in you. Shut out the
world, shut out light and sound, only let me feel your
arms around me, pressing my bosom to your heart as
now. All my life is compressed within my heart, and it
is bursting to meet yours. I am blind, deaf, dead to all
but you. I have scarcely self enough to say ‘I have no
self.’ I love myself in you. Oh, my greater self! my
larger life!”</p>

<p class='c010'>So the softly flushed and moist cheeks, the heavy,
liquid eyes, and the palpitating bosom said, but no word
escaped the parted and glowing lips. Nor could a word
have escaped between the kisses that were pressed upon
them. Then he released her, and they sat upon the old-fashioned
sofa by the glowing hickory fire in the old
wainscoted parlor, and, hand in hand, talked. Oh, how
they talked! Sometimes with profound earnestness,
sometimes with light and bantering gayety.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yet you have had many admirers, Elsie,” said Magnus.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have I?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Elsie, you know that you have.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I try not to know it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, dearest?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Because I wish I was an Eastern bride for you. Oh,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>yes! I wish that I had been reared in conventual seclusion,
that no man’s eye had seen me until my husband
came to claim me; that, then, I could have gone apart
from the world and seen only him. That would have
been exquisite; that would have been blissful; for I do
not want admiration; I want only your heart’s approval!
There would be such intense and concentrated joy in
knowing only you. My joy would be diluted if my heart
were divided among many.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But your numerous admirers, dearest?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, my numerous admirers! I did not finesse when
I asked you if I really had any; for, in truth, my ‘admirers’
never came near enough to me to breathe their
admiration.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why was that? How was that? Tell me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Look in my eyes, love, and read your answer there.
Peruse my heart, love. It lies open to you as a book.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nay, tell me. I love to hear you talk. It delights
me to listen to you. Tell me now. It is some sweet
secret that will give me heaven to know. Come, love, be
generous. Breathe the secret out upon my bosom,” he
whispered softly, and drew her again to his heart.
“Come, love——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I will. I will repress this feeling of reluctance,
and tell you all my thoughts. Yes, for surely I feel you
have a right to have an answer to any question you ask
me, my higher self. Listen, then. Bend low, for I shall
whisper very low, lest the air around should hear me.
When you first drew me on to love you, when leaf by
leaf my heart unfolded and developed under the life-giving
warmth of your eyes, of your touch, just as a rose
buds and blossoms under the rays of its sovereign, the
sun—my heart, I mean, or something rising within it—taught
me many mysteries that neither prophet, priest,
nor sage could have taught me. Among other things,
it revealed to me the knowledge of all that would please
and all that would displease you in myself, and impelled
me to follow the first and eschew the last. It made me
wish to isolate myself for you. It killed the very first
germ of vanity in my heart, and made me wish that none
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>should come near enough to me to know whether I were
beautiful or otherwise, far less so near as to tell me of it.
It made me shrink from all those little gallantries from
gentlemen which make up so large a portion of a belle’s
life. I was so afraid of being found unworthy of you
when you should take me. I should not have felt good
enough for you if my hand, that awaited your hand, had
been squeezed and kissed, and my waist, that awaited the
dear girdle of this arm—fold it closer around me now—had
been pressed, and I, your expectant bride, had been
twined and whirled about in the giddy waltz. But none
of these things have happened to me. I come to you
almost an Oriental bride for exclusiveness, and that
makes me so happy. I should have else been unhappy,
should else have been unworthy of you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>All this was murmured slowly, softly, dreamily, as
though the truth stole out of a slumbering heart, while
she lay upon his bosom, and the last words were breathed
forth in an almost inaudible sigh. But he answered with
passionate vehemence, clasping her to his heart:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Unworthy of me! You! so beautiful! so good! so
intellectual!—save when your highest intellect is
whelmed in feeling!—yet, no—your highest intelligence—your
spirit—is never so whelmed! You, the heiress
of the haughtiest family in Maryland—and I—who
am I?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My greater self! my life-giver!—by these titles only
I know you. Does my rank and fortune offend you?
Pluck me away from them; for I am yours. Bury me
with yourself, in some lone forest cabin, in the wilderness,
whither your footsteps tend; and there my hunter’s
wife will forget the world, while preparing the cabin for
his return at eve. And she will not think the hours of
his absence long, for they will be filled with fervent
thoughts of him. Oh, that hunter’s lodge in the wild! I
see it even in my dreams!”</p>

<p class='c010'>And this was not romance; but the passionate fanaticism
of first, of early love.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Elsie! how you talk!” he exclaimed, gazing on
her eloquent face with wonder, reverence, and passion.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>She blushed deeply, and bowed her crimson brow upon
his bosom, murmuring:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do I? I am sorry. I suppose maidens do not talk
so; do they?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not know how maidens do or should talk, any
more than you do,” answered Magnus, and then a singular
expression passed over his countenance. He bent his
gaze upon her, with a look of profound thought and
searching inquiry, as though to read the depths of that
heart she had so freely laid open to his perusal. And he
said, very seriously: “I do not know how maidens talk,
for I have spoken with but one maiden before of love.”
He paused and gazed down deeply into her eyes, as if to
read her most hidden thought and feeling—possibly he
expected to see some trace of jealousy there—he saw only
the calm, profound repose of love, deep joy, and infinite
trust. He resumed: “I never talked with but one
maiden of love before; she was my first love.” Again he
looked down, and saw upon her beautiful face the same
ineffable peace. He continued: “I loved her passionately.
I lost her. It nearly maddened me.” For the
last time he gazed down upon her, as she lay quietly over
his arm, with her face turned up to his, but her whole
countenance radiated with a sort of calm, rapt ecstasy,
as though she were then in the possession of all the bliss
possible on earth. He gazed for a moment, full of astonishment,
and then quietly asked: “Is it possible that this
gives you no uneasiness, my love?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Does what?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The thought of my first love.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, dearest. Why should it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Why should it?’ What a question. Why should
it not?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know, I am sure. When I do, I’ll tell you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yet,” said Magnus thoughtfully, “though the idea
of my having had a first love gives you no pain, you
felicitated yourself and me very much upon the fact of
your having had no other lover.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, that was a very different thing. Don’t you feel
that it was?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>“Yes; I feel it. But tell me now—think—why is it
that the thought of my first love does not distress you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Indeed, I do not know at all. I only know by the
sure inspiration of my soul, and feel in every nerve of
my body, that you love me; and I am so ineffably
blessed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My darling Elsie!” he said, joyously kissing the lids
down upon her two sweet eyes. “My darling Elsie, you
are not selfish or jealous for yourself at all. I only
wished to probe your heart a little. You were so jealous
for me that I thought perhaps you might be so for yourself.
You are not, my darling Elsie; my light of life!
You are the only woman I ever loved! Yet, dearest, I
told you no fiction. You, yourself, were ‘the maiden to
whom I spoke before of love.’ But it was soon after
you returned from school. You, yourself, were the
maiden whom I lost,—for a little while, during our short
misunderstanding,—and whose loss nearly maddened
me. Oh, come! enter the heart of hearts, and live there
forever!” He clasped her closer, and they subsided into
silence, or conversed only with their eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>Long, long they remained in that still trance of joy,
but at last Elsie withdrew herself, laughing, from his
arms, sat down beside him, and they began to talk of
their future home. He told her it would be indeed a
cabin in the backwoods of Maryland; but not a hunter’s
cabin, as she fancifully supposed. Oh, no! but a country
doctor’s dwelling, in a new settlement. And that he
would not return at eve in the hunter’s picturesque costume,
with a gun and a nine-antlered deer across his
shoulders, but upon the back of a stout mule, with a country
doctor’s saddle-bags behind him. How would she
like that?</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, very well, dearest Magnus! for then you will be
saving life instead of taking it. Oh, yes, I do like—I do
love—your profession, Magnus. Since you must have
one, I like it better than any other you could have chosen.
I think physicians do more disinterested good than any
other set of men on earth. I will not even except the
preachers. Oh, yes! I do love your profession, dear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>Magnus, and love you better, if possible, for being a
poor country doctor. God love and bless you! When
you shall have come home tired, from your long round—oh,
you shall have sweet repose, love—indeed you shall!
God bids me to assure you that you shall. Whatever our
cabin home may be, I can make it a little haven of repose—a
little heaven of bliss for you. Oh, indeed I do not
fear; my whole full soul assures me that we shall be
happy and victorious over fate. Let me kiss your eyes—you
kissed mine just now, so sweetly. God bless those
grand eyes! Oh, Magnus, can a cabin or a garb of
homespun hide the light, the greatness that is in you?
Oh, Magnus, I saw a king and several princes of the
blood when I was presented at court by General Armstrong;
but their foreheads were low and receding, their
presence had the strut without the dignity of majesty.
Oh, Magnus, their kingly crown could not have given
either that magnificent forehead of yours. Oh, Magnus,
there is something greater in you than any surrounding
you can have. Do not any more dread that I shall be
either pained or revolted at anything in the circumstances
of our condition. The rough walls of a log cabin will
not shock or sadden me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, darling, for the rough walls of our log cabin, like
the rough bark of an oak tree, has something really picturesque
about it; but”—said he, in a half-sorrowful,
half-comic way—“the pots and kettles, the mops and
brooms!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What! the humble little household gods and goddesses
that set up no pretension to worship, or even to
honorable mention, and yet confer so much benefit? No,
indeed. I have a kindly feeling for all such. Mine, if
they can’t be beautiful, shall be neat and pretty. Oh,
don’t you remember when we were children, and used to
run in out of the snow to old Aunt Polly’s kitchen, and
how she’d press us in to help her every time she could?
Oh, I know a great deal about cooking, and I always had
a turn for housekeeping.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He arose, took her hand, and raised her up, and looked
at her from head to foot, as she stood—that delicate,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>beautiful girl, in her elegant ball dress of gossamer crape
over white satin, diamonds sparkling on her arms and
neck, as he had said, like icicles upon snow. He surveyed
her, from her white rose-wreathed auburn hair to
the tip of the white satin slipper. He clasped her hand,
and looked at it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know,” she said, “what you are thinking of again—‘Elsie
must doff this dress, and this style of dress, for
some years to come’; but do not fear, within ten years,
and by the time that the beauty of your love has matured,
Elsie will weave a more elegant dress than this,
when her husband’s talents shall have ‘achieved greatness.’
And this little hand that you look at so fondly, so
sadly—‘this pure, fresh, delicate thing, a jewel itself,’ as
you called it just now—under this soft, white cushion of
flesh are nerves and sinews of steel. I am very strong,
dear Magnus, very strong every way. And I can work;
this hand shall toil and retain its beauty, because you
prize it, too.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He clasped her again to his breast, and drew her white
arms up around his neck. And then that notion of isolation
came upon her again like a fond superstition, and she
whispered:</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not want neighbors or friends where we live,
love. I want only you. I want no one that can take me
off from you. It is late. Shall I go?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, dear love,” she answered, untwining her arms
from about his neck.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>When they re-entered the ballroom the revelry was
still at its height. Six cotillions were on the floor.</p>

<p class='c010'>Judge Jacky was flying about, now here and now there,
now everywhere at once.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ambrosia Wylie, in a gold-colored satin, that harmonized
well with her warm-hued tone of beauty, sat in the
bay window, the sunny center of a system of satellites.</p>

<p class='c010'>General Garnet, who had got through with the political
business that detained him at Huttontown, had just arrived,
and was now standing apart, conversing with
Lionel Hardcastle. He frowned darkly on seeing Elsie
enter the room leaning on the arm of Magnus, and both
looking so self-possessed, confident, and happy.</p>

<p class='c010'>He smoothed his brow quickly, however, excused himself
to Lionel, and advanced toward them. Bowing
slightly to Magnus, he took the arm of Elsie, and saying
that he wished to have a conversation with her, drew her
off for a promenade.</p>

<p class='c010'>In going off, Elsie turned, smiled on Magnus, and
said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“If I do not return in half an hour, Dr. Hardcastle,
you must seek me out,” and, bowing playfully, she went
on.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Was that done to insult me, Miss Garnet?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, dearest father, it was done out of respect to Dr.
Hardcastle; as you forgot to excuse yourself to him for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>taking me off so abruptly, it would have been scarcely
courteous in me to have left him without a word. We
would not have treated a common acquaintance so,
father.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A common acquaintance! And pray what more is
Dr. Hardcastle entitled henceforth to be considered?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“As my husband, and as your son-in-law, father.”</p>

<p class='c010'>General Garnet turned pale, and spoke low, with suppressed
rage:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your husband, and my son-in-law! I—would—see—him—and—you—in
the lowest pit of h——l first!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Elsie gave a violent start as this awful word struck
her like a bullet. It was the more awful, that Elsie had
never known her father to forget himself so far before.
Violence shocked her, profanity revolted her; she was
unaccustomed to either. Her father, even in his tyranny,
was habitually polite. Her mother was ever gentle.
Fury, threats, were strange to her; and now came this
terrible burst of passion, the more terrible for its half
suppression. She gazed at him in alarm. His face was
white with anger, but it reminded her of the white ashes
upon a burning coal. He continued in the same deep,
stern tone:</p>

<p class='c010'>“How dared you even receive that young man’s attentions,
after I have withdrawn my countenance of
him?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Father, because his attentions were my right and his
right. Who else, in your absence, could have attended
me with so much propriety?” asked Elsie, trembling in
her flesh, but firm in her spirit.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do not commit the impertinence of answering my
question by asking another again, Miss Garnet. A question
which, impertinent as it was, I will answer. ‘Who,’
you inquire, ‘in my absence, could have attended you
with so much propriety?’  I reply, Mr. Lionel Hardcastle,
the gentleman under whose protection I placed you
for the evening.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And who wickedly abused his position by addressing
the words of love to one whom he knew to be Dr. Hardcastle’s
betrothed wife.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>“Death! if you say that again,” exclaimed General
Garnet, trembling with fury.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And whom,” continued Elsie, frightened, but resolute,
“I had therefore to dismiss as soon as I found Dr.
Hardcastle.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He grasped her arm with a violence that might have
crushed it. He set his teeth, and drew his breath hard.
He could not shake or beat her there—not in that room
full of company—among those hundreds of people. He
could not even let them see the rage that was on the
eve of explosion.</p>

<p class='c010'>He looked around. Seeing Lionel Hardcastle at a
short distance, he beckoned him to approach, and, without
relinquishing his vise-like grip, said, in a deep, hurried
tone:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do me the favor to call my carriage, sir, instantly, if
you please.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Lionel opened his soft, bright eyes in a look of wide
surprise, turned on Elsie a gaze of mingled admiration,
sorrow, and deprecation, and, bowing to General Garnet,
moved off to comply with his request.</p>

<p class='c010'>General Garnet grasped Elsie’s arm with a suppressed
fierceness, and pulled her after him into the hall, thence
out into the portico, and down the steps to the carriage
door. Pushing her forcibly in, he jumped in after,
pulled to the door, commanded the coachman to drive
rapidly for Mount Calm, and was soon whirled away on
the road to that place. He maintained a stern silence
toward Elsie during the whole ride.</p>

<p class='c010'>Arrived at Mount Calm, he sprang from the carriage,
took Elsie out, drew her arm roughly within his own,
and pulled her up the steps.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Has your mistress retired?” was the first question he
asked of the servant at the door. The man started at
the fierce abruptness of his master’s tone and manner,
and replied hurriedly that she had.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is very well. Go wake up the housekeeper; ask
her for the keys of the attic-room, and bring them to me
yourself, with a night-lamp.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man hurried away in dismay. And General Garnet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>remained there, still with his violent grasp upon
Elsie’s arm. When the servant returned with the bunch
of keys and the light:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Precede me upstairs, and on up into the attic,” said
General Garnet; and grasping Elsie more tightly, he
fiercely hurried her on, till they reached the first floor,
and the wide hall into which the family chambers opened.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Father, this is my chamber door. I wish to retire,”
said Elsie, pointing to the door on her left. But her
father hurried her past it.</p>

<p class='c010'>The servant was now going up the attic steps, but
paused to look down upon the scene.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Father, what are you about to do?” asked Elsie, holding
back. Her attire had been very much disordered by
the violence with which she had been hurried in, her
cloak and hood had fallen off below stairs; now her beautiful
dress was tumbled, and her hair in wild disorder.
“What are you going to do, father?” she asked again,
drawing back.</p>

<p class='c010'>But he turned upon her sharply, shook her furiously,
as though he would have shaken the life from out her;
and then seeing the horrified gaze of the servant standing
on the stairs, he exclaimed, “Up into the attic, and
wait for me there, instantly, sirrah. And consider yourself
already sold to a trader, for your insolence in watching
me!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The appalled servant vanished up the steps, and the
unmasked tyrant turned to Elsie, and tightening the
grasp that he had never relinquished, dragged her to the
foot of the attic stairs. Here the girl sank with all her
weight upon him, upheld only by his hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Up, up the stairs with you!” he exclaimed fiercely.</p>

<p class='c010'>Elsie had too much physical strength to swoon, and
too much presence of mind to scream. She would not
have terrified her poor mother to no good purpose. Yet
her agitation was so great, with augmented astonishment
and terror, that she could not move.</p>

<p class='c010'>He seized her violently, drew her up the stairs until
they had reached the narrow attic passage, and commanding
the negro to unlock the door that stood before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>them, forced her into the room; dismissed the servant,
locked the door on the inside, and turned upon her.
Elsie had dropped into an old flag-bottomed armchair,
where she sat shivering with cold and fear. He turned
upon the delicate and trembling girl fiercely, scornfully,
triumphantly, tauntingly, as if she had been some rough
male adversary in his power. He placed the key in his
pocket, buttoned up his overcoat, and stood looking at
her with a bitter, sarcastic laugh, saying:</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have insulted and provoked me sufficiently this
evening, Miss Garnet! You were very happy and confident
an hour ago. What do you think of your prospects
now?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Elsie shuddered and was silent.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Can you escape from this room? Will you jump
from one of those windows and fall a hundred feet?
Will your lover find a ladder long enough to reach you?
I think not. Can you break that lock? I think not.
Will you bribe your jailer? I think not; for I shall be
your jailer myself. No one else shall enter this room.
And now listen to me,” and taking a chair, he sat down
before her, and said in a hard, harsh voice, “I do not care
one jot for all the miserable, contemptible love sentiment
in the world; I never did! I do not believe in it.
I never did! But that which I want, and that which I
will have, is the union of these two joining estates,
Mount Calm and Hemlock Hollow. That project is as
dear to old Mr. Hardcastle as it is to me. It was for
that reason, and not upon account of any trifling, mutual
predilection of yours, that we were about to negotiate a
marriage between my daughter and his nephew, when
fortunately Lionel came home in time to arrest the execution
of the plan; of course it was perfectly easy to see
what then became the duty of all parties.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Fidelity,” said Elsie in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>General Garnet laughed tauntingly, and continued
without further notice of her reply:</p>

<p class='c010'>“The young man who was to inherit the estate was to
have the bride. It mattered nothing to me whether that
were Magnus or Lionel; but the hand of my heiress was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>to be bestowed upon the heir of Hemlock Hollow. That
was the treaty. So I reminded old Mr. Hardcastle. He
remembered that it really was so, and fully and entirely
agreed with me. Young Lionel Hardcastle is also conformable.
You only are contumacious. But I have
pledged myself to your consent, and, by Heaven, you
shall redeem my pledge. Listen, minion! You never
leave this room until you leave it as the wife of Lionel
Hardcastle. Curious place for a marriage ceremony!
but, come, it does not matter; we can have the wedding
afterward. You were to be the wife of Dr. Hardcastle,
as you very respectfully call him, on Thursday week.
Ha! ha! ha! Come, what do you think of your prospects
of marrying him now?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Father, as far as my marriage with Dr. Hardcastle
on Thursday week is concerned, my fate has gone out
of my hands and into God’s! I have no more to say
about that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ha! ha! I should think not. Not quite so confident
as you were an hour ago, hey?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But, father, forgive me for reminding you that as
far as marriage with any other person is concerned, that
is entirely in my hands for refusal. Church and State
very properly make the bride’s consent an indispensable
preliminary to marriage, and even a vital part of the
marriage ceremony. And my consent can never be
gained to marry Lionel.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ha! my pretty piece of stubbornness, we shall see.
Pray, do you know—have you ever felt the power of
solitary imprisonment, cold, and hunger, in bringing a
contumacious girl to docility?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Elsie’s face flushed, more for him than herself.</p>

<p class='c010'>He continued:</p>

<p class='c010'>“For all those mighty engines can I spring upon you!
And will I, by Satan and all his hosts!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Father, you may do that, and nature may faint and
succumb to their power. I am very strong, but those
things you threaten me with may be stronger still. But,
father, if ever I am left with strength enough to stand
before the minister with Lionel Hardcastle by my side,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>when that minister shall ask me whether I will promise
to love, honor, and obey him till death, I shall answer,
‘No, I do not love him, I never did, I never shall. If I
stand here to be married to him, it is to please my father,
his father, and not myself! And so I cannot tell a falsehood,
far less vow one in God’s presence about it. I love
Dr. Hardcastle, to whom you all know that I have been
long engaged. I always did love him, and always shall,’
and then let the minister of God marry us, if he durst.”</p>

<p class='c010'>With a furious oath he sprang upon her—seized her—the
idea of strangling her upon the instant darted
through his brain; but he only shook her with frenzied
violence, and holding her in his terrible grip, said, with
a husky voice and ashen cheek, and gleaming eye:</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you were to do so, girl, as God in heaven hears
me, I would kill you!”</p>

<p class='c010'>And she felt to the very core of her shuddering heart
that he told the truth. Then he dropped her, and threw
himself out of the room, leaving her there, half dead
with cold and fright, in the miserably bleak attic, without
a spark of fire or light, for the lamp had been blown out
by the fury with which her father had banged the door.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Early the next morning Mrs. Garnet arose softly,
without awaking the general, and thrusting her small
feet in wadded slippers, and drawing on her wadded
dressing-gown, passed into her daughter’s chamber for
the purpose of looking silently upon her while she slept,
to see whether she bore the fatigue of the ball well. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>went in softly, drew the curtains of the bedstead, and to
her surprise, found that it had not been slept in. Her
first thought, of course, was that Elsie had remained all
night at Point Pleasant.</p>

<p class='c010'>She felt disappointed, and returned immediately to her
own chamber, rang for her maid, and proceeded with her
morning toilet.</p>

<p class='c010'>Her maid, Milly, entered, bearing on her arm the cloak
and hood that Elsie had worn to Point Pleasant, and
afterward dropped while being dragged through the
passage. Mrs. Garnet gazed at her in fixed astonishment,
saying:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, where did you get those, Milly? Is it possible
that your Miss Elsie has returned so early this
morning? Where is she?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Miss Elsie returned last night, missis, and must have
dropped these in the passage, for that is where I found
them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Returned last night! Her bed has not been occupied!
Where is she?” exclaimed Mrs. Garnet, dropping
the long mass of golden curls that she had been twisting
into a knot, and standing aghast with vague terror.
“Where is she? What is the meaning of this? Why
do you look so strangely? Oh, my God! what has happened
to my child? Speak this moment, Milly! What
do you know of it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought you must a’ known, Miss Ally; marster’s
locked her up in the garret.”</p>

<p class='c010'>All the blood of the Chesters rushed to the brow of
Alice, and crimsoned it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Locked Elsie up in the attic!” she exclaimed.
Then: “Give me the keys! Where are they? Bring
me the keys instantly!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Please, Miss Ally, marster took the garret key off of
the bunch, and put it in his pocket.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Leave me, Milly. Go! Hasten! Go downstairs!
I don’t want you this morning,” said Alice, conscious of
having betrayed too much emotion in the presence of her
servant.</p>

<p class='c010'>Milly left the room, and Alice hastened, with a flushed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>brow, and trembling hand, to the big armchair at the
head of the bed, over the back of which hung the general’s
clothing that he had worn the night before. Alice
searched all the pockets of the overcoat in vain. And
she took up the dress coat.</p>

<p class='c010'>But while Alice was hunting for the key, the general
had risen upon his elbow, and, unseen by her, was watching
her motions with a demoniac leer.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alice searched all the pockets of the dress coat, and it
was not there. Then she raised the vest, and in the
pocket found the key. She seized it eagerly, and was
about to fly off with it when a heavy blow felled her to
the floor! The key dropped from her hand. General
Garnet stooped and repossessed himself of it, and looking
at her with a laughing devil in his eye, said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, was that you? Excuse me, madam! I beg ten
thousand pardons; but waking up suddenly, and seeing a
hand in my pocket, I naturally enough supposed it to be
that of a thief! It’s Heaven’s mercy that I had not shot
you by mistake, my dear!”</p>

<p class='c010'>But seeing that she did not move, he leaned further
over the side of the bed, and perceived that in falling the
back of her head had struck the corner of the dressing
bureau, and that she was stunned by the concussion—stunned
or dead, he did not know which. He jumped to
the floor and raised her. Her head and limbs fell helplessly
over his arms. He laid her on the bed, ran his
fingers through the golden tresses of her hair, but found
no fracture; there might be a concussion of the brain, but
there was no outward sign.</p>

<p class='c010'>He started to the bell to ring it, but before he got
there changed his mind and returned, locked the door,
went to the bureau, and taking a couple of linen handkerchiefs,
tore them in strips, and took a lancet from his
case (all planters kept such things for the exigencies of
the plantation). He then went to the bedside, ripped up
the sleeve of Alice’s dress, and baring the arm, opened a
vein. As the blood began to flow—first very sluggishly,
then faster—she opened her eyes and looked at him. He
then bound up her arm, and telling her that he hoped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>this sharp lesson would teach her the danger of opposing
his will again, left her and proceeded to dress himself.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alice attempted to rise, but her head grew dizzy, her
eyes dim, and she sank back at the same moment that he
sternly bade her be still, and not venture to leave her bed
that day. He dressed, and left the chamber.</p>

<p class='c010'>At noon General Garnet returned and entered the
room, and approaching the bedside asked Alice how she
felt.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Only drowsy, inclined to sleep while lying down, but
sick and dizzy and blind when I attempt to rise.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If that be the case, you must not, upon any account,
yield to that inclination to sleep. It is dangerous; you
must rise and sit up.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I cannot—I wish I could—I cannot. I turn deadly
sick as soon as my head is lifted.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Alice—I—think I must bleed you again,” he said,
taking out the lancet and baring her arm. Then he hesitated
a moment; he doubted whether this second bleeding
would be right, but he resolved to risk it rather than
risk the exposure of their secret by sending for a physician.
He opened the vein again, and while the blood was
trickling, looked so full of solicitude that Alice felt sorry
for him, and said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Never mind; don’t you know I knew it was an accident—the
striking of my head against the bureau.” She
now looked so much better again that he ventured to say,
as he bound up her arm:</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope, Alice, that this will be a profitable lesson to
you, at least. Consider. You—you might have been
killed.” Then he raised her in a sitting posture,
propped pillows behind her, took a seat in the big chair,
and said: “This is really a trifle as it turns out, Alice.
This dizziness will soon pass away if you sit up. Only,
I hope, as I said before, that this will be a warning to
you, for it might have been much more serious, or even
fatal. It is dangerous, Alice, dangerous to rebel either
by stratagem or force against just authority. And, now
listen, for I wish to talk to you of Elsie for two reasons—first,
to keep you from falling into an injurious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>sleep; and, secondly, to let you know my reason for confining
her, and my plans and purposes toward her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And then General Garnet, for the first time, openly
avowed to his wife his fixed determination to break off
forever the projected marriage between Magnus and
Elsie, and to bestow the hand of the latter upon Lionel
Hardcastle, giving her his reasons in full for doing so,
and declaring his intention to keep Elsie confined until
her consent was obtained, and to take her then from her
room at once to the altar, that no deception might be
practiced. Alice dreaded lest he should ask her opinion,
or her co-operation. Fortunately for her, he did not consider
either of the least importance, and soon rising, left
the room and went down to dinner.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alice pressed both hands to her head and groaned
forth the prayer:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, God! guide me aright through this labyrinth of
crossing duties, lest I lose my way!”</p>

<p class='c010'>In the afternoon General Garnet went out again.</p>

<p class='c010'>And soon after he was gone Milly entered her mistress’
chamber and put in her hand a little slip of paper,
which she said Elsie had given her as she handed in her
dinner.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alice took it eagerly. It was the flyleaf of her pocket
prayer-book, and on it was picked with a pin the sentence:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Say something to me, beloved mother.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Alice asked for a pencil, and wrote:</p>

<p class='c010'>“To-morrow I will write, dear child.” And then the
pencil dropped from her hand. “Milly, when you take
her supper up, give her that,” she said, and closed her
eyes from exhaustion.</p>

      <div class='line in26'><i>—Old Song.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The next morning, after General Garnet had left the
house—for the whole day—Alice arose, still dizzy and
weak, not only from the effects of the blow, but from
fasting and anxiety. She was scarcely seated in her
chair when a letter was brought to her that had come in
the mail-bag from the post office. It was superscribed
in the handwriting of Dr. Hardcastle. Alice tore it open,
and read a much longer epistle than I can find space to
transcribe here, reader, but the sum total of it was this:
Magnus informed his friend Alice of what she already
knew—General Garnet’s expressed determination to
break the engagement existing between himself and
Elsie, for mere mercenary motives; of his own and
Elsie’s fixed resolution to abide by their betrothal, and
his hopes that their decision would meet her—Alice’s—approval.
He told her of his wish that their marriage
should take place on Thursday, as had been first proposed;
and of his intention to depart on the following
Monday for his home, among the new settlements in the
backwoods of Maryland. He told her, farther, that he
had called the day before to see her and Elsie, but that he
had been refused admittance at the very threshold, the
servants adducing their master’s commands as their warrant.
He had heard, he said, that Elsie was immured,
but hoped and believed that this was not so. He concluded
by entreating Alice to write and inform him of
her own and Elsie’s state of health and spirits, and advise
him how to proceed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alice folded the letter, clasped her hands, and closed
her eyes a moment in intense thought and prayer. Then,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>bidding Milly wheel her writing table before her, she
took pen and paper, and wrote the following short but
important note:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Magnus</span>:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“As soon as you see this, go to a locksmith and send
him instantly to me. Then get a carriage, procure your
license, call at Fig’s to take up the young Methodist minister
who boards there, and come at once to Mount Calm.
When you return, Elsie shall accompany you.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Your friend,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>“<span class='sc'>Alice Garnet</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>She sealed this note, dispatched it, and then dropped
her head into her hands, holding it tightly, as though to
chain thought to its object. Then once more she drew
her writing-desk nearer to her, took her pen, and wrote
these hurried lines to Elsie:</p>

<p class='c016'>“Within a very few hours from this, my own dear
Elsie, you will be released and married. And now let me
tell you, my own dear child, my reasons for advising and
aiding you in this step. It is not only, my Elsie, that
your heart has long been given to Magnus; that your
hand has long been pledged to him with the approbation
of both your parents; that your happiness is concerned
in being united to him; that your honor is implicated in
keeping faith with him; it is not, either, that it would be
a heinous wickedness to forsake your betrothed at the
very moment that fortune forsakes him, and in the hour
of his greatest adversity; it is not that this very desertion
of yours would shake his faith in all that is good and
true in heaven or on earth, palsy his energy and enterprise,
and thus do him a serious mortal and social injury.
And, on the other hand, it is not that you do not
love Lionel. No, Elsie, it is simply because Magnus is
entirely the better man of the two,—better, incomparably
better,—physically, mentally, morally, religiously. Magnus
is healthful, strong, handsome, energetic, highly intellectual,
purely moral, profoundly religious; and he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>loves you completely. Lionel is broken in constitution,
evidently by excess; indolent, selfish, voluptuous, yet irritable
and often violent. His interest in you is a low
compound of vanity, cupidity, and sense—it would be
false and profane to call it by the sacred name of love.
Magnus would make you better and happier, in loving
you greatly, in elevating your moral and religious nature,
while Lionel would draw you down to the misery
and degradation of his own low nature. My child, my
one lone child, it is for this consideration that I bar you
from wealth, luxury, ease, adulation, and give you to the
stern but kindly discipline of poverty, toil, and privation—with
love by your side, to lighten all your labors and
God above you to reward them. May God love you, my
only child! my little Elsie!”</p>

<p class='c010'>No tear-drop blotted this paper, though her tears had
fallen thick, and fast, and blindingly, while she wrote it.
She had turned her head away; for no sign of sorrow
should wound and weaken Elsie in the letter written to
comfort and sustain her. She had turned her head away,
and the tears had rained upon her lap. Many times she
had arisen from her writing desk and fallen, overcome
with grief, upon the bed. But it was done. She had
succeeded. And there was nothing upon the paper or in
the letter to betray the anguish of mind in which it was
written.</p>

<p class='c010'>Trying to steer as blamelessly as she could through
her labyrinth of duties, Alice would not call one of the
servants, all of whom had been expressly forbidden to
approach the attic, but took the paper herself, went feebly
up the stairs, and supporting herself by the balustrades,
she reached the topmost landing, and went to the door of
Elsie’s room.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are there, dear mother. I know your footstep
so well, though it is weaker than usual. And if I did
not know your footsteps, I should know your sigh. Dear
mother, do not grieve for me. I am happy—reverently
be it spoken—as Peter was in prison.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My darling Elsie, here is something I have written
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>for you. I will push it under the bottom of the door.
Take it, darling, read it. Try to compose your mind, and
be ready for me very soon. I must go now, dear, for
when you begin to read that you will find I have a great
deal to prepare. Good-by, for an hour, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Alice then went down, entered her chamber, and rang
for Milly; then she went to her drawers and caskets, and
got together all the jewelry that she possessed, to the
amount of several thousand dollars, and all Elsie’s, that
amounted to several thousand more, and placed them in
one strong casket. Then she searched her purse and
pocketbook, and took out all the money she had in possession,
a few hundred dollars, and put it in a strong
packet. Then she sent Milly into Elsie’s vacant chamber,
and had all her clothing collected and packed into
two large, strong traveling trunks. Next, she sent for a
man-servant to come and lock and strap them down before
her face. Lastly, she received the keys from him,
and told him to procure assistance, take the trunks down,
put them into a cart, carry them over to Huttontown, and
leave them at Mr. Fig’s, with a request from her that he
would keep them until they were called for. When
Alice had done this she was told that a man wished to
see her in the hall.</p>

<p class='c010'>She went out, and found the locksmith with his tools.
She bade him to follow her, and led the way up into the
attic, and to the door of Elsie’s prison. She stopped
there, and turning to the locksmith, said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Pick this lock.”</p>

<p class='c010'>No sooner said than done. The man put in his instrument
and unlocked it with as much ease as though
he had used a key.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There, thank you, sir! you need not open the door.
Please to retire now. Milly, my girl, will settle with
you downstairs,” said Alice, who did not by any means
wish to “reveal the secrets of that prison-house.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man bowed, gathered his tools, and went downstairs.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alice opened the door, and was instantly locked in the
arms of her daughter. Fearing to lose her courage and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>presence of mind, perhaps trembling for the strength of
her purpose, too, Alice did not venture to indulge these
enervating endearments, but hastened to say:</p>

<p class='c010'>“You read and understood my note, my dear Elsie?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, mother.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You know, then, what is about to take place?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, dear mother.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come, then, my child, we must be quick. I expect
Magnus here with the license and the minister every
minute. Your trunks are already packed and sent off to
Huttontown. Where are your diamonds, Elsie? I did
not see them among your jewelry. They are the greatest
portion of your dower now, my child. Where are they?
I wish to put them into a casket that I have packed for
you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Here they are, mother, with the ball dress in which
I came to prison.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah, that ball dress, put that on, it will do as well as
another; or, no, you will perhaps have no time to change
it afterward. Come down into my room, and put on
your traveling dress at once. I have left it out with
your bonnet; come, Elsie.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you please, ma’am, Dr. Hardcastle and Parson
Wilson are downstairs, inquiring for you,” said a servant
from the foot of the interdicted stairs.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Invite them into the back parlor, and say that I will
be with them in a few minutes,” said Alice. “Come,
Elsie, hasten, dear, and let me dress you.” She drew
Elsie down.</p>

<p class='c010'>She felt no weakness or dizziness now. She was upheld
by a strange excitement. Her cheeks and lips
seemed burning, and her eyes blazing as with a hectic
fever.</p>

<p class='c010'>Arrived in her own chamber, she quickly assisted Elsie
to put on her traveling dress, smoothing her beautiful
auburn ringlets, pressed her again fondly to her bosom,
tied on her little beaver bonnet, and led her downstairs
into the back parlor, where Dr. Hardcastle and the minister
sat.</p>

<p class='c010'>Both forward, bowed, and shook hands.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>“Oh! for God’s sake have it over quickly, Magnus,
lest my strength fail!” said Alice, trembling violently.</p>

<p class='c010'>The minister drew the prayer-book  from his pocket
and opened it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Elsie suddenly lost every vestige of color, and threw
herself again into her mother’s arms. Alice pressed her
passionately to her heart a moment, and then gave her
up to Magnus, who took her hand, passed his arm around
her waist to support her, and stood before the minister.</p>

<p class='c010'>In ten more minutes Magnus Hardcastle had the joy
of clasping his wife to his bosom.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank Heaven that it is over! Oh-h-h! Ugh-gh-h!
I felt my flesh creeping all the time, as if father were
peeping over my shoulder,” exclaimed Elsie, shuddering,
and burying her head under the arm of Magnus.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, thank Heaven, it is over! It was short. A
few solemn words of exhortation, a brief prayer, a
briefer benediction, and now I possess you, without a
doubt, or dispute—entirely. The laws of God and man
give you to me alike, and no power under heaven can
tear you from me, my own Elsie! my own wife!” said
Magnus fervently, and almost crushing her in his arms.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, thank Heaven it is over! The doubt, the struggle,
and the fear is over. You are safe, Elsie. Your
happiness, as far as human foresight can secure it, is insured,”
said Alice, as she received Elsie once more from
the arms of Magnus, and folded her in her own.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But you! Oh, my dear mother! you will be left
without your child!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Never regret me, my own darling. You go without
your mother, but you go with your husband, and you are
happy. Are you not, my Elsie?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, yes, yes, mamma.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I am left without my daughter, but I remain
with my husband. Think that I am happy also,” said
Alice, feeling thankful to Providence from the bottom of
her heart, that Elsie was “innocent of the knowledge” of
General Garnet’s tyranny over herself.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet Elsie half suspected, she knew not what. She
looked deeply, searchingly, for an instant into her</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>mother’s dark blue eyes, as if to read the secret of the
deep sorrow in them.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Alice dropped her long lashes, and averted her
head.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then Elsie took her hand, and bending round to look
into her troubled face, said, slowly, earnestly, tearfully:</p>

<p class='c010'>“You love my father dearly, very dearly; don’t you,
mamma? Say, don’t you, mamma? Oh! don’t you,
mamma?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, Elsie, I love him,” said Alice, in a very low
voice, turning again to her daughter.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, mamma, you love him as well as I love Magnus!
Don’t you, mamma? Don’t you? You love him better
than you love me, and you will be very happy with him
even when I am gone? Say, mamma! Oh, tell me before
I go.”</p>

<p class='c010'>For an answer Alice stooped and kissed her daughter
on the forehead.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But oh! tell me before I go! Tell me that you love
my father better than you love me, and that you will be
very happy with him when I am gone,” said Elsie, growing
more anxious for an answer every instant.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alice turned very pale.</p>

<p class='c010'>And Magnus, who saw that she was fast losing her
self-control, came to her relief, by saying, as he approached,
took her hand, and drew her off:</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have a word to say to you, if you please, Mrs.
Garnet.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They went to a window, leaving Elsie near the parson.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mrs. Garnet! Cousin Alice! Dearest friend! I
have a proposal to make to you that must surprise and
may shock and offend you. But nevertheless, I make it.
Listen to me, Alice. I know too well what you have
risked for us, and what you have incurred at the hands
of your husband this day! Alice! I fear—I tremble at
the thought of leaving you here alone, and exposed to his
terrible wrath. You——”</p>

<p class='c010'>But Alice raised her hand and gently arrested his
speech.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>“Magnus, forgive me for reminding you that you
should not talk to me in that way. General Garnet’s
displeasure, as far as I am implicated, will perhaps be
just. You and Elsie were right. Your faith was
pledged with his consent. You were right in redeeming
your mutual pledge. But I, perhaps, was wrong in assisting
you in it. I do not clearly know. Oh, Magnus,
for many years my ideas of right and wrong have been
very much confused. For many years I have lost sight
of the exact line that divides good and evil. Oh, Magnus,
when the eyes are dimmed with tears, the sight is
not very clear—and when the soul is drowned in grief,
Magnus, the moral vision may be very much obscured.
But this I know—that General Garnet’s anger, just or
unjust, moderate or violent, I must meet, and meet alone.
By all means alone! The dignity of both is concerned in
that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Alice, you must not! Hear me! Listen to me! Do
not turn away with that air of gentle self-respect, and
wave me off! Don’t I know that your heart is breaking
this moment—this moment, that your child is leaving you,
and you are left desolate and exposed to danger! Desolate,
wretched, in peril, though you would have her to
believe otherwise? Oh, Alice, you may deceive the child
of your bosom, but you will not deceive the boy who sat
at your feet and loved you, and studied the mystery of
the sorrow on your brow when you came home a bride,
and everybody called you happy. I was not deceived
then; I have not been deceived since. Oh, Alice, my love
for Elsie, my love for you, my relation toward both, give
me the right to feel, the right to speak and advise. Hear
me: You must not remain here to meet the anger of
your husband. Your life—your life will be endangered.
Nay! do not lift your hand to stop my speech; hear my
plan; hear me out—I will be very brief. Listen! You
love Elsie and me. Go with us when we leave here. Go
with us to our backwoods home. Our home will be
humble, but full of peace and love, and the repose you so
much need. We shall be poor, but you shall not feel it.
Respectful and loving hands will wait on you all day
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>long. You will be happy with us. Remain with us till
the storm blows over. There need be—there would be—no
exposure, no gossip, no scandal. To the neighbors
who knew of our betrothal, our marriage and departure
will seem perfectly natural, only rather unsocial because
we did not give a wedding. And I can answer for the
discretion and fidelity of Wilson. Your accompanying
us, for a visit, will seem nothing unusual. General Garnet,
if I mistake not, is too much a man of the world
not to keep his own secret, and too much of a despot not
to enforce silence upon his people, in regard to this matter.
General Garnet will be very anxious to get you back
before your visit is prolonged to a suspicious extent.
And then, Alice, while you are safe with us, you can
make your own conditions with him for your return.
You can secure for yourself——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Stop! Magnus, I do not wish to mar the harmony
of this sad hour by one dissonant word or thought or
feeling. But let me hear no more of this. Not one
breath more, dearest Magnus. What! I leave my home!
leave my husband, and remain away to make conditions
with him! I, who unconditionally pledged myself to him
‘for better or worse’—I, who vowed love, honor and obedience
to him ‘until death’! No Magnus. That marriage
vow, in all its details, is not to be tampered with.
It is not a question of happiness, or of peace, or of expedience,
or of repose, or of affection, but simply of duty.
No, Magnus. When I hastened to bestow my daughter
upon you, it was for the reason that I believed you
to be one toward whom it would be a happiness as well
as duty to keep sacred, in all its minutiæ, that marriage
vow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Alice, dearest Alice, your heart is very mournful, and,
forgive me for saying it, very morbid.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is? Call Elsie, then. Her feelings are all singularly
healthful. Call her, and in her presence just invite
me to go with you, simply to go with you—that will be
the mildest form of your proposal—and see what Elsie
will say. Come, do so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Magnus turned with a smile, and beckoned Elsie to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>approach. Elsie came, with her bright face beaming
with interest and inquiry.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Elsie, my love,” said Magnus, “I have been trying to
persuade your mother to accompany us to our new home,
and remain there for a few weeks.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And leave father so suddenly, when I am leaving
him, too! Oh, don’t press her to do any such a thing,
dear Magnus. Oh, don’t think of leaving father just
now, dearest mother,” said Elsie earnestly; then throwing
herself in her mother’s arms, whispered anxiously:
“Mother, don’t you love father? Oh, mother, tell me,
before I go, that you love father.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, Elsie, I do love him. No, Magnus, I cannot
leave him. I have helped to bereave him of his child for
a season—I cannot leave him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But, oh, Alice!” said Magnus, drawing her apart,
“think again! think what you will meet. How can you
brave his anger?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall not brave it, Magnus. It may be just, coming
from him. At least I must bear it—patiently, too.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Just then the door was burst open by a servant, who
exclaimed, in affright:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Madam!—mistress!—doctor!—Miss Elsie! Marster
is a riding down the road, post-haste, to the house!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, my God! there is not a moment to spare. Good-by,
my beloved child. God bless you!” said Alice,
straining her daughter to her bosom.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, mother, don’t you love father dearly? Tell me
once more.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, yes, Elsie.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, mother, if you love him so dearly, get my pardon
from him. Tell him how I grieve to be under the
necessity of offending him. Get my pardon for me, beloved
mother.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will do my very best. God bless you, my darling
child! Good-by! Oh, Magnus, be good to her, be merciful,
be loving, be tender. Oh, Magnus, I have torn
the heart from my bosom and given it to you. Be good
to her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“May God deal by my soul as I deal by her heart!”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>said Magnus, folding his mother-in-law in a fervent embrace.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then they hurried out, hastened into the carriage, the
blinds were let down, the doors closed, the whip cracked,
and the vehicle rolled away.</p>

sigh of relief, and rising, she hurried off to her own chamber.
Not to sit down in faithless despair, but to write
a letter to General Garnet, softly and meekly breaking to
him the news of their daughter’s marriage, so that the
first shock of astonishment and rage should be over before
he should come home and she should have to meet
him. She wrote this letter. It contained all that she
had said in her letter to Elsie, and much more; besides,
a meek, appealing spirit pervaded it, that few hearts could
have resisted. She dispatched it by a servant to General
Garnet at Hemlock Hollow. Then she lay down and
tried to sleep.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>She was disturbed by the entrance of a servant bearing
a letter.</p>

<p class='c010'>She raised up and took it. It was for General Garnet,
and bore the post-mark of Huttontown. She regarded it
attentively for an instant, for it was written in a coarse,
schoolboy-like hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then she placed it on the dressing-table, and, dismissing
the servant, lay down and closed her eyes again, with
an effort to sleep. She could not do so for a long time.
Emotion was busy in her heart, and thought in her brain.
One, two, three hours passed; and then she prayed,
prayed for the promised rest, and, praying, fell asleep.</p>

<p class='c010'>She did not know how long she had slept, when, waking,
she perceived General Garnet in the room.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was sitting in the large armchair near the bed, and
his attention riveted upon a letter he was reading. Alice
glanced at the dressing-table. The letter she had placed
there was gone. Yes, it was that letter which he was
reading with such fixed interest.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alice lay quietly, yet anxiously watching him, until he
finished reading, folded up the letter, and put it in his
pocket. His attitude was one of deep, even intense,
thought. In the crimson twilight of that closely curtained
chamber she could not see the expression of his
face. It was evident, she thought, that he had not seen
her in the shadowy recess where her sofa stood.</p>

<p class='c010'>After thus watching a moment, breathing a prayer for
mercy, she slowly arose, crossed the room, and sank
upon the cushion near his feet, took his hand, and looked
up pleadingly into his face.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alice was still a very beautiful woman, as I have told
you, and never was a more beautiful picture than that
kneeling figure, with the bright, flowing hair, flushed
cheek, and upturned, pleading gaze with which she
sought silently to deprecate the anger of her husband.
She sought to read her fate in his countenance; but that
high and haughty face was lifted and averted, and its
features were stern, and calm, and impassible. Then she
found words to speak, and inquired, softly:</p>

<p class='c010'>“You received my letter, General Garnet?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>“Yes, madam, I received your letter,” he answered, in
a hard, cold tone of voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then you know what else I should tell you here at
your feet.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know that my daughter has eloped, and that my
wife helped her off,” he replied, in the same dry tone,
and with his head still averted.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alice could not see that his lips were bloodless and
compressed, and his eyes burning with a fearful, lurid
glare. His very quietude, hard and dry, and constrained
as it was, deceived her. She took his hand again and
pressed it to her lips, and held it to her bosom, murmuring
softly:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let us forgive each other! Oh, my husband, let us
forgive each other! For many wrongs there is positively
no other remedy in the wide universe but simple forgiveness—simple,
magnanimous, sublime forgiveness. ‘It is
impossible but that offenses will come,’ said the most
merciful of all beings. It is impossible, says the experience
of life, it is impossible but that disappointments,
sorrows, pains, and partings will come. They are the
conditions of our existence. We cannot escape them.
Let us lessen their bitterness as much as we may. It is
impossible but that troubles will come, but the vital question
is whether we shall turn them to good or evil account—whether
we shall live to any good end or not.
Oh, my husband, make friends with me! We have only
each other in the wide world upon whom to depend for
our life’s comfort and happiness. Make friends with
me!”</p>

<p class='c010'>She paused, covering his hand with fond caresses,
pressing it to her lips, laying it against her cheek, holding
it to her throbbing heart. He drew his hand from her
gentle clasp, and folded his arms.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alice sank back, sobbing—sobbing, as though her
heart would burst—then suddenly she clasped his knees,
exclaiming wildly: “Can we hate each other—you and I
who have lived so many years together? Can we hate
each other—you and I, who love our only child, our dear
Elsie, so much? Make friends with me! Let us understand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>each other! Let us be candid with each other!
Let us forbear each other! I know that you deeply regret
the failure of your favorite plan to unite these
estates. I know it; I am sorry for it; sorry that I have
been constrained to have a hand in it. But, oh, General
Garnet, I, too, you know, was once—long years ago—bitterly
disappointed—terribly disappointed! But it is all
over now; it has all been over many years ago! And
that is what I have often wanted to tell you, when I saw
by the cold, dark shadow on your brow that you thought
yourself unloved. But I never could approach you near
enough to tell you—to tell you that if you would look
into my heart you would see it filled with the love of
God, of my husband, and my child. Oh, Aaron! let us
forget all that estranged us in the dreary past, and see
if we cannot live a better and happier life in the future!
At least we can be kind, candid, forbearing with each
other. Think how long we may have to travel the rough
road of mortal life side by side! We are not old—you
and I, Aaron! You are not forty-five, and I am much
younger. People healthful as we are usually live to the
age of eighty and beyond it. Think how many years we
may have to live together! Shall we, through all these
years, be unloving, cold, estranged, suspicious, uncharitable
each to the other? Think how many years of our life
we have already wasted in coolness, strangeness, misunderstandings!
Think how many yet remain! Shall we
not live the rest in mutual forbearance, candor, benevolence?
Make friends with me. Let us comprehend each
other. Dear Aaron, I have opened my heart to you;
give me your confidence!” She ceased, half turned to
gaze up in his face; his head was quite averted—had he
relented? She thought so. She suddenly, impulsively
arose, threw her arms around his neck, and bent her lips
to kiss him, repeating softly: “Dearest Aaron, make
friends with me. Give me your confidence.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He sprang up, and with one dash of his strong arm
threw her from him, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Off, traitress! Off, serpent! Viper!”</p>

<p class='c010'>She tottered and fell back among the silken cushions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>of an old-fashioned low lounge, exhausted, pale, and
shuddering.</p>

<p class='c010'>He gazed at her with flashing eyes and darkening
brow, and white and writhen lips, and the long restrained
passion broke out in a torrent of invective. Shaking his
clenched fist at her, he exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c010'>“How dare you talk to me of confidence, traitress that
you are? How durst you even approach me, serpent!
viper! after your black treachery? What do you mean
by braving me? Are you enamored of a broken head?
Or do you think your own too hard to be broken? At
what do you value your life, pray? What hinders me
now from strangling you? Why didn’t you fly with
your hopeful daughter? Don’t you expect me to hurl
you out of doors after her? How durst you cross my
path after your treachery? Viper, answer me, I say!”
he vociferated, striding toward the lounge, grasping her
shoulder, and jerking her to her feet before him. “Answer!
How dared you face me after your black treachery?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was no treachery,” answered Alice, pale and trembling,
yet with a certain gentle dignity in her words and
tone; “it was no treachery; I broke no promise; I betrayed
no trust; I am incapable of doing either.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Silence, traitress!” he thundered, shaking her furiously;
“I do not ask you for any impudent falsehood; I
will not, by Heaven, permit you to tell me one! I ask
you how you dared to meet me here?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh-h-h!” sighed Alice, suddenly sinking at his feet.
“It was to return to my allegiance; at whatever personal
risk, to yield myself to you; to abide henceforth by
my duties. And oh, General Garnet, do not misunderstand
me! If I have humbled myself before you—vainly,
perhaps, it is not from so base a motive as fear! Oh, I
have outlived and outsuffered the fear of pain—the fear
of death—the fear of anything that might befall me! I
am at your feet. If I have placed myself unconditionally
in your hands, it is for the sake of the holiest principles,
the most sacred duties. General Garnet, you believe
me—I see that you do! General Garnet, listen to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>me farther; this is positively the first time in our married
life of seventeen years that I ever opposed you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The first time that you ever successfully opposed me,
madam; and, by Heaven, you have made a signal beginning!”
commented General Garnet, no longer speaking
in a furious voice, but in the dry, hard, stern tone, and
fixed, inflexible brow with which he had in the beginning
of their interview heard and replied to her gentle words.
The burst of violent passion had passed away and left
him—the hard, scornful, sarcastic, yet cool, calculating,
dissembling, most dangerous man that he was before.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alice gazed up at his face, seeking to read the changed
expression there; but it passed her skill, and she murmured
slowly:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps I was wrong; I know that under other circumstances
it would have been very wrong; yet I dare
not say that I regret what I did, for under the same circumstances
I should do it again. Not to obtain your
forgiveness would I deceive you, though to obtain it
would make me comparatively happy; but I deeply regret
that anything I had a hand in should give you pain.
And I say, do as you please, I shall not complain, I
cannot. From the one revolt of my whole life I return
to a full and unconditional allegiance; there is nothing
farther to disturb it, nothing to draw me aside. My love
for my child only did it; that cannot move me again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ha! can it not?” he asked scornfully.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, no, indeed it cannot!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Never!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Never! How can my love for Elsie ever again draw
me aside from you? Elsie is married and gone; now I
have only you; my duty is undivided—and, oh, if you
would let me, I would try to make you so happy!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Would you?” he asked, doubtfully, scornfully.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I would,” she said, suddenly rising, leaning
her hand upon his arm, and her head upon his shoulder,
with the confidence of perfect love and faith. “Oh,
Aaron, you have not been yourself for a few days past.
Yet I do not love you the less on that account; indeed,
I do not. Oh, Aaron, I can excuse your violence more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>than you can excuse yourself, I know, for I have been
used to it in others. My father was violent sometimes.
And I know that anger is a brief intoxication—’a short
madness’—in which people do and say what they never
intended. Come, you are not angry now; you are smiling;
and I—I can only repeat what I said in the beginning,
‘Let us forgive each other, and live better and happier
all our future lives.’ That is right—put your arm
around me, dear Aaron, for I am very weak.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was scarcely in human nature, or in devil nature,
to resist the charm of her winning beauty, gentleness,
and meekness. General Garnet pressed a passionate kiss
upon her lips, and clasped her to his heart. It was the
first kiss of many, many years; and Alice, trembling,
happy, with her blushing face hidden on his bosom, saw
not the “laughing devil in his eye.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Aaron, this is generous—this is magnanimous.
Oh, Aaron, if you knew how the simple act of forgiveness
has power to bind the human heart! I know it by
the way it draws my heart to yours,” said Alice, with
enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c010'>But another and a more passionate kiss sealed her lips
for a time.</p>

<p class='c010'>At last she said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“My friend, how has it been with you this long, long
time? I mean how has it been with your heart and soul,
your inner life? Have you been happy—have you had
any great life purpose? Oh, Aaron, often when I have
watched you in your daily life, as you walked, or rode,
or drove; as you sat at table, or at your writing-desk,
or settled business with your overseer or agents; or jested
or told anecdotes among your friends; when you have
seemed to live lightly on the outside of things, I have
longed to ask you, ‘How is with you—is this reality,
and is this all of your life, and are you contented with it—are
you happy?’ And when I have seen you sit, or
stand, or walk apart, silent, moody, abstracted, retired
into yourself, I have longed to knock at your heart’s
door, to be let in, too—to be let into your confidence,
and to give you my sympathy, but I dared never to do so.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>It has taken the grief and passion of this hour to enable
me to do so now. But this shall never be so again, shall
it? We shall never be such strangers to each other
again? Come, tell me now—how it is with you. Are
you happy?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Quite happy, just at this hour, Alice.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And do you truly love me—a little? Oh, love me—only
love me!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Love you! That is not so difficult, Alice. You are
still a very lovely woman.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will you let me deliver Elsie’s last message to
you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>He quickly averted his face to hide the dark cloud
that overswept it, while he answered:</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will hear it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Elsie’s parting words to me were, ‘Oh, mother, you
love my father very dearly, do you not?’ I answered,
‘Yes.’ She replied, ‘Oh, if you love him, mother, win
my pardon from him!’ Aaron, look on me. Father,
forgive your child for loving her husband as much as
her mother loves thee.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Alice,” he said, drawing her again to his bosom and
kissing her, “this seals your full pardon; be content; for
the rest, give me time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, if I could persuade you to forgive poor Elsie—who
only needs her father’s pardon and blessing to be
perfectly happy in her humble state.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Alice, if Elsie were before me, as you are, in all your
beauty, perhaps I could not choose but be reconciled with
her as with you, my lovely Alice.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Alice was so unused to praise from him that these
words and caresses were beginning to embarrass her.
Blushing like a very girl, she withdrew herself from his
arms, and sat down. Then, as fearing to have offended,
she said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do not think me ungrateful. Test my sincerity in
any way you please.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“In any way, Alice?” he asked significantly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes. Try me—test me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Pause—think—in any way?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>“In anything and everything will I obey you, that
does not transgress the laws of God, I mean, of course.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah, that to begin with, is one very broad and comprehensive
exception—especially if you design to give it
a very liberal and latitudinarian interpretation. And it
implies, besides, a suspicion and a guard against my giving
you any command which, to obey, would be to transgress
the laws of God. Do you really suppose that I am
capable of doing such a thing, Alice?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No—oh, no. Only you pressed me for an exception,
you know, and I gave you the only one I thought of.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am satisfied with your exception, Alice. But is
that really the only exception to your vow of compliance?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, indeed, the only one.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Reflect—you may find another.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No; indeed, no.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No? What is the dearest wish of your heart, now,
Alice?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“For peace—for perfect family peace and perfect
Christian love.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thanks, Alice. ‘Almost thou persuadest me to be a
Christian.’ But is there no secret, darling thought that
hovers around Magnus and Elsie?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Alice suddenly turned very pale. Her hands flew up
pleadingly, and involuntarily she cried, in a voice of
anguish:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, for the loving Saviour’s sake, do not require me
to renounce Elsie!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If I did, would you do so, Alice?”</p>

<p class='c010'>She was silent, with her head bowed upon her clasped
hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>He looked at her and smiled sardonically, saying:</p>

<p class='c010'>“I knew it—another exception! How many would
follow this, I wonder? But be easy, Alice. I do not require
you to renounce your daughter. Far be that from
me. Hold her as closely to your heart as you wish.
Nothing but nervousness could have put that thought
into your head. Have I not said that even I might be
brought to forgive Elsie? Pshaw, dear Alice, I only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>wished to prove to you how really vain were all your
promises.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, they are not!” exclaimed Alice earnestly,
energetically. “You have reconciled yourself to me
when I least hoped and expected it, and I will do anything
to prove how glad I am—anything except renounce
Elsie or fail in my higher duty to Heaven. Oh,
do not close your half-opened heart to me again!
Try me!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good! I will put your sincerity to one more test.
And woe to both if that third test should prove you
faithless.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It shall not—it shall not!” said Alice solemnly. “All
our future confidence and peace depends on it, and it
shall not fail, so help me Heaven. What is it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You shall soon see, Alice,” replied General Garnet,
rising and preparing to leave the room. “Where are
they now?—I mean Dr. Hardcastle and his wife.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I believe they are at the hotel at Huttontown, where
they expect to remain for a few days—if you do not
bring them back here. Oh, General Garnet, if you would
pardon them—if you would bring them back here to
live with us—how happy we should all be—oh, how
happy we should all be the long future years! No more
partings—no more tears. Our children and grandchildren
would be with us all through life. Magnus
could practice his profession, and be of such inestimable
value besides, in your political plans, and such company
for you at home. And Elsie would be such a comfort
to me. We should all be so happy! Come, bring them
back with you. Ah! do. Let us have them with us,
all reconciled, around the table to-night—and it will be
the happiest family gathering that ever was held. Oh, I
see you smile, and I know you will bring them back—will
you not?” said Alice, suddenly seizing his hand, and
gazing eloquently, beseechingly into his face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We shall see, Alice—I will tell you more about that
when I return,” he said, with one of his charming smiles,
and shaking her hand cheerfully, opened the door and
went out.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>“Oh, yes—I do believe he will bring them back with
him. Ah, no father can harden his heart against his
child. Yes, yes, I am sure he will bring them back!”
she repeated, seeking to still the anxiety that was tormenting
her breast.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sun was going down when a servant entered the
chamber and announced that Judge Wylie was below
stairs and begged to see Mrs. Garnet alone upon important
business.</p>

<p class='c010'>Telling the man to show Judge Wylie into the library,
Alice threw a shawl around her, and, full of vague and
painful misgivings, descended the stairs.</p>

<p class='c010'>What could be the important business upon which
Judge Wylie came? What business, trifling or important,
could he have with her? Had any accident happened
to Elsie? The thought gripped her heart like a
vise. Had anything happened to Magnus or General
Garnet?</p>

<p class='c010'>Trembling and pale, and almost overwhelmed by the
trials of the day, she opened the library door and entered
in.</p>

<p class='c010'>Judge Wylie was standing there awaiting her. Judge
Jacky’s usually jubilant face was now overcast and
troubled as he advanced to meet Alice, took her hand,
led her to a settee, and seated himself beside her. He
pressed her hand with paternal kindness and said, gravely
and gently:</p>

<p class='c010'>“My dear Mrs. Garnet, you will pardon the liberty
about to be taken by your oldest friend.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“For Heaven’s sake—what has——” happened, she
was about to ask, but the words died on her pale lips.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>“Do not be alarmed, my dear Mrs. Garnet. Nothing
has occurred since the marriage—you perceive that I
know all about it. But it is to warn you—to put you
upon your guard against something about to occur, that
I come to you this evening.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“For God’s sake—what? what?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Be easy. Nothing that you have not in your full
power to avert by a little firmness.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“For Heaven’s sake, explain yourself, Judge Wylie.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You know something, I presume, of the Maryland
laws of property, of inheritance, and of marriage?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, no; I know nothing about it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“At least you know that when a girl marries, all the
personal property she may be possessed of at the time of
her marriage, or may afterward inherit, becomes the
property of her husband?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, of course, I know that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, but—listen. All the landed property she possesses
at the time of her marriage, or afterward inherits,
is hers—hers alone. Her husband can neither alienate it
during his life, or will it at his death. He cannot mortgage
it, nor assign it, nor can it be taken for his debts.
It is hers, and hers alone. She alone has the disposal
of it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes. Well?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Therefore, all the personal property you became possessed
of at the death of your father is the property of
General Aaron Garnet.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Certainly. Who disputes it? Well?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But. And now listen! All the landed property, consisting
of six thousand acres of the best land on the
Western Shore, which you inherited from your father, is
yours, your own, and at your death it is your daughter’s,
if she survive you, and unless you choose to will it to
someone else. General Garnet can make no disposition
of it either during your life or at your death.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It seems to me, Judge Wylie, that this conversation
is a very singular one,” said Alice coldly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not so singular or so impertinent—that is what you
mean—as it appears to be. Bear with me. Hear me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>out. I speak for your good, and your child’s good, I
have before me now the face of your sainted mother.
I loved her in my youth, Alice; but that is neither here
nor there. Well, this is what I had to say: Your daughter
Elsie has, by her marriage, grievously offended her
father. He may or may not pardon her. He may discard
her. Do not put it in his power to disinherit her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Alice turned very pale.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why do you say that to me?” she asked falteringly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Because,” he answered, “it is said that women can
always be kissed or kicked out of any right of property
they may happen to possess. Now, don’t you, my little
Alice, be kissed out of your six thousand acres of finely
cultivated and heavily timbered, well-watered land, with
all its land and water privileges. The best plantation
within the bounds of old Maryland. Don’t you be kissed
out of it, little Alice, for it makes you independent and
of great importance. Don’t you be kissed out of it,
Alice, for you can leave it to your beloved daughter, who
will need it. Don’t you be kissed out of it, Alice, my
child; and as for the other alternative, my courteous
friend, General Garnet, is far too much of a gentleman to
resort to it, either literally or metaphorically.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Judge Wylie, why do you talk to me in this way?
You are my oldest friend; you have a certain privilege.
I beseech you, forbear to abuse it,” said Alice, divided
between mortification and anxiety. The latter at last prevailed,
and she asked: “Why did you open up this subject
just now, Judge Wylie? You came to tell me why,
I suppose. Tell me now at once.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, then, only this, Alice. That about an hour ago
I happened in at Squire Fox’s office, where General Garnet
was superintending the drawing up of a deed. An
involuntary—a providential—glance, now I think it was,
over the clerk’s shoulder revealed to me the fact that he
was drawing up a deed of assignment, by which you
were to convey all your right, title, and interest in the
landed property of Mount Calm to General Aaron Garnet.
General Garnet then turned to me and requested
me to meet him here to-night, to witness your signature.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>I asked, with surprise, if you had consented to give it.
He looked offended, and expressed astonishment at my
question. By which I knew that he intended to come
upon you by a coup de main, and I came off here to put
you on your guard.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, is that all?” asked Alice, with a sigh of great
relief. “Well, Judge Wylie, if anyone else in the wide
world had talked to me as you have been talking for the
last ten minutes, I should have said that they took a
most unwarrantable and most offensive liberty in presuming
to interfere in a matter that concerns only General
Garnet and myself. Of you, my old friend, I only
say that your doubts and fears are totally groundless.
General Garnet, perhaps, wishes to test the strength of
my confidence in him, or he may have some other and
still better reason for what he is about to do. At all
events, when he lays that deed before me for signature,
most willingly, most cheerfully, will I prove my love and
respect, and confidence in him, by signing it at once.
Judge Wylie, I am not well this evening. The events of
the day have shaken me very much. Judge Wylie, with
many thanks for your kind intentions, permit me to wish
you good-evening.” And Alice held out her hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>Judge Wylie arose, saying:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah! I knew it. I might have known it before I
came. She will not be saved when she might be. She
is like all her sex: none of them ever will be saved, unless
it’s those who aint worth saving. Well, good-evening,
Mrs. Garnet! God be with you! It is said that
children and—pardon me—fools—enjoy the privilege of
an especial Providence. May such a protection be yours!
Good-evening, madam.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And pressing her hand, he took his hat and stick, and
was about to leave the room, when the front door was
heard to open, steps to hurry up the hall, and the library
door was thrown open, and General Garnet entered,
ushering in a magistrate and a lawyer, who held some
documents, tied with red tape, in his hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah, Judge Wylie! I am glad to find you already
here. Gentlemen, be seated. Alice, my love, I preferred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>to bring these gentlemen here, for the purpose of transacting
a little law business in which you are concerned,
rather than risk your health by taking you out in this
severe weather. Judge Wylie, resume your seat. Gentlemen,
pray be seated. Alice, my love, come hither; I
had expected to find the library empty, and you in your
chamber, where I left you. I wish to have a word with
you apart.” And putting one arm affectionately over
the shoulder of Alice, he took her hand, and led her
away to a distant part of the room, where, with his most
angelic smile, he said: “Alice, I am the nominal master
of Mount Calm only! but, Alice, I am at this moment
a poor man. Prove your affection and confidence now,
as your heart dictates!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know what you mean, Aaron. Come! I am ready
to do so—at once. But, oh, Aaron! have you seen
Elsie?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will tell you all about that after this little business
is over, dear Alice! Come.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Immediately after?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, instantly, and it will take but a moment.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come, then, let us have it over quickly, that I may
the sooner hear of Elsie. But, oh! just assure me of this—that
you have forgiven her! I know by your smile that
you have—but, oh! I long to hear you say so!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Can you doubt me, Alice? Come! let us have this
affair over, and then you shall know all about it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And taking her hand he led her up the room.</p>

<p class='c010'>The magistrate was seated behind a table; before him
lay a copy of the Holy Scriptures, pen, ink, and paper,
and certain documents, among which was the deed of assignment
in question. By the side of the table stood
Judge Jacky and the lawyer, as witnesses.</p>

<p class='c010'>General Garnet led Alice up in front of it, and immediately
before the magistrate.</p>

<p class='c010'>Squire Fox took up the deed of assignment, and read
it aloud. Then he administered the oath to Alice, and
put the usual questions, as to whether she gave that deed
of her own free will, without compulsion, or undue persuasion
from her husband?</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>“Without being kissed or kicked out of it?” whispered
Judge Jacky.</p>

<p class='c010'>Having received satisfactory answers to all questions
the magistrate laid the deed open before Alice, for her
signature. General Garnet dipped a pen in ink and
handed it to her. Alice received it, smilingly, and in a
clear, unfaltering hand, wrote her name at the bottom of
that deed, that conferred upon her husband immense
wealth and left herself penniless.</p>

<p class='c010'>The lawyer affixed his signature, as witness. Judge
Wylie, with a deep groan, wrote his name. The squire
performed his part, and the business was complete.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alice looked up into General Garnet’s face, with an
expression that said—“Now have you proved me sufficiently?
Now will you confide in me? Will you love
me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>General Garnet stooped down and whispered to her:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Retire immediately to your chamber, Alice!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But—Elsie—tell me of her?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Retire to your chamber, instantly, Mrs. Garnet!—and
await me there! I must offer these gentlemen something
to drink, and dismiss them; immediately after which, I
will come to you, and tell you all that I have done, and
all that I intend to do!” said General Garnet, in a tone of
authority and impatience, that would brook no opposition
or delay.</p>

<p class='c010'>And Alice, courtesying slightly to the party, withdrew.</p>

<p class='c009'>Alice retired to her chamber and waited restlessly.
An hour passed, and still she heard no sound of departing
guests. It was quite dark and she rang the bell.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>Milly entered with lights.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tea is ready to go on the table, Miss Ally. Shall we
put it up?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where is your master? What is he doing?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He is in the library, ma’am, with the gentlemen.
They don’t seem to have any notion of going home.
General Garnet—he sent for more wine, and ordered
deviled turkey and scalloped crabs—two other gentlemen
have come in, and they are all very high upon
pullyticks.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Alice heard and sighed deeply.</p>

<p class='c010'>“So I thought, Miss Ally, how you’d like your cup
of tea, anyhow. Shall I set the table as usual? Though
it will be very lonesome for you to sit at the table all
alone, now that Miss Elsie is gone, and marster’s engaged.
Or else shall I bring you a cup of tea up here,
with anything else you would like? There is some cold
fowl in the pantry, and some neat’s tongue, too; shall I
bring it up to you, with a cup of tea?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, Milly. Perhaps the general would like supper
got for his guests. Come with me; I will go down and
see.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“God bless your soul, Miss Ally, honey, they’s been a
stuffing ever since they’s been here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No matter for that, Milly; you know our gentlemen
have infinite gastronomic capacities.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My Gor A’mighty, Miss Ally! you don’t say so. Is
it catching?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That there complaint our gemmen has got.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nonsense, Milly! you misunderstood me; I meant to
say that they had ‘no bottoms to their stomachs.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My Gor A’mighty! Miss Ally, what a misfortunate
state to be in. It’s a world’s wonder as it don’t kill ’em
to death!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Pshaw, Milly! There is nothing the matter with
them except that they never get done eating.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, is that it, Miss Ally? Well, indeed, I don’t believe
they ever does; especially when they is a talkin’
pullyticks. ’Case, you see, Miss Ally, I done sent ’em
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>in four dozen scallop crabs and six dozen raw open Nanticoke
oysters, each one of ’em as big as the palm of my
hand, and two deviled turkeys, and bless patience if they
didn’t put all that away in less than an hour, and sent for
more.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, they will want a hot supper by and by, that is
certain. So take the candle, Milly, and go before me.
I am going down to the library door to speak to General
Garnet.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Milly lifted the candlestick, and preceded her mistress
down the stairs.</p>

<p class='c010'>When she reached the library door Alice stepped before
her and rapped.</p>

<p class='c010'>General Garnet came to the door and opened it. On
seeing his wife:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, what do you want now? Didn’t I direct you
to keep your chamber until I came?” he inquired sternly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; and I would have done so, but your visitors are
staying longer than you or I supposed. Perhaps they
will need supper; shall I order it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No! Mind your own business. Don’t go beyond
your orders. Return to your room and wait me there,”
he said, and shut the door in her face.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alice sighed, and turned from the door.</p>

<p class='c010'>Milly was indignant. This was the first time she had
ever positively witnessed any disrespect shown to her
beloved mistress. And Milly boiled with rage.</p>

<p class='c010'>“High! Who he? Mus’ think how people ’fraid o’
him. My Lor’! I only jes’ wish how my ole man, Tom,
’ould turn a darned etarnal fool in his ole days, and talk
to me so! that’s all! ‘High!’ I say, ‘Nigger, better hit
somebody, hadn’t you? Is you done tuk o’ your ole
woolly head’s senses?’ ’Deed I would. Look here, Miss
Ally, honey! Don’t you put up o’ that there shortness.
Now Miss Elsie’s gone, he can’t spite you any way. He
daren’t hit you. ’Case why? ’case the law protects you.
Now, Miss Ally, I say, you take my ’vice. You jes’
pluck up a sperit and turn on him. And put a ’stonishment
on to him. Jes’ you step it over him in style.
Make him walk chalk. Ses you, ‘Now, you behave yourself,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>or I’ll unmask you afore all the world, and let people
see how pretty you are underneat of your smiles.’ Lor’,
Miss Ally, if men aint the easiest spil’t and a-made fools
of, of all the dumb beasts as ever wore shoe leather.
There’s my old man, Tom. Why, anybody’d think he
was the bestest old nigger as ever said prayers. But
Lor’! when we first took up ’long o’ each other, the
cussed infunnally fool thought he was master; thought
how he’d got a nigger of his own. Ugh—umph! I soon
took him out o’ that there. I wa’nt a-goin’ to lay down
on the ground and let people walk on me. Now he
’haves himself as a man ought to do. ’Twon’t do, Miss
Ally, ’deed it won’t, Miss Ally! to spile men folks. Men
folks ’quire to be made to know their places. ’Deed,
’fore my Heavenly Marster, they do, honey.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Doubtless Alice would have rebuked this freedom of
speech, had she heard one word of it; but she did not.
She only knew that Milly was twaddling some monotonous
strain of monologue, as she carried the candle before
her upstairs.</p>

<p class='c010'>Arrived within her chamber Alice dismissed her maid,
refusing all refreshment, and threw herself, exhausted
and anxious, upon her bed.</p>

<p class='c010'>As the hours passed slowly away, sounds of revelry
from below stairs began to reach and disturb her. As
time wore on toward midnight these orgies became
louder and higher. Vociferous laughter, shouting songs
and thundering cheers mingled in a strange wild discord,
and broke startlingly upon the aristocratic repose of that
mansion and the holy quiet of that night. Alice listened
in fear and trembling and disgust, for such orgies
were unprecedented there.</p>

<p class='c010'>At length, long after midnight, the company broke up
in great disorder. Alice listened shudderingly to their
noisy leave-taking, as with jocular songs, coarse jests,
vociferous cheers and laughter, they departed. Then she
heard the closing of doors and windows, and the steps
of General Garnet as he moved about the house. Lastly,
she heard him coming up the stairs. He entered the
chamber. Alice rose to meet him.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>“Oh, you are waiting to hear something about Elsie.
Well, sit down,” said he, putting down the night-lamp,
closing the door, and turning to her with a sarcastic
smile.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alice had sunk into a chair, faint, sickened by the
sight of the demon leer that now he did not even turn to
conceal.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, now, what questions do you want to put to me?
I am quite ready to answer any,” he said, dropping himself
into a chair before her, crossing his feet, folding his
arms, and leaning back.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Elsie, then? Have you seen her?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What, not seen Elsie!” she repeated, with a look of
deep disappointment. “Not seen Elsie?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” he answered again, looking at her with steady,
imperturbable contempt.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But you—you intend to see her?” asked Alice, with
a sinking voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Never! Never, so help me Heaven! And now listen,
minion! fool! It was for the purpose of punishing
her and you—of beggaring her and you, that I obtained
that deed!” he exclaimed, malice, scorn, taunting triumph
writhing around his lips, flashing from his eyes,
and lighting up the whole dark face with a lurid demoniac
fire.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alice stared at him for an instant with a marble-like
immobility of countenance, as if it were impossible for
her to comprehend such black treachery.</p>

<p class='c010'>Stretching out his arm, and pointing his finger at her,
he laughed aloud.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then the spell of amazement that checked the current
of her blood was broken, and slowly from the pallid lips
came the words:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, my God! I understand it all now!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ha! ha! ha! do you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All—all,” she continued, without withdrawing her
steady gaze—“all, all. I have sold my birthright and
hers, for—a kiss!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ha! ha! ha! Well, what do you want to complain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>of? You got the kiss,” he exclaimed, in the most insulting
manner.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have sold her birthright for a kiss! a serpent’s kiss!
a Judas kiss!” cried Alice, wildly wringing her hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come, Mrs. Garnet, no hard words, if you please.
Remember how you hung upon me this morning. You
were so affectionate! I was quite flattered; grew ‘quite
in favor with myself,’ and almost with you—only it is
impossible to rekindle ashes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, fiend, fiend! remorseless fiend! I shall go mad!
Oh, God! where sleep your thunderbolts?” cried Alice,
rising, and walking distractedly up and down the floor.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come, madam. No more of this. I am tired of it.
Resume your seat,” exclaimed General Garnet, leaving
his scornful, taunting manner, and speaking in the deep,
stern tones of haughty command.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Alice heard him not, as she walked wildly up and
down the room, crying:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, God! God! where rest your thunderbolts?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you hear me? Sit down, I say! or, by Heaven,
I will send you in search of the thunderbolts!”</p>

<p class='c010'>But Alice was not to be stopped now. Still wildly
walking up and down the floor, distractedly wringing
her hands, she was pouring forth the gathered bitterness
of many years.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have borne so much, great God. I have borne so
much. Oh, I have been a woman ‘of sorrows and acquainted
with grief.’ And who is it that has made my
life, my harmless life, one long pain? You, General
Garnet, you. You married me by force, you know you
did. In my young girlhood—nay, in my innocent childhood,
when life opened to me with such a bright promise
of usefulness and happiness with one I loved, with one to
whom my faith was plighted, you tore me away from
that one, and made his life a useless, barren waste, and
married me yourself, for your own selfish purposes, and
nearly broke my heart and crazed my brain. God knows
I have no clear recollection now of the months that followed
my marriage. Well! Well! Well! ‘Time and
the hour beareth away all things,’ and as time passed, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>learned to love you. Because you were my husband,
and the father of my child, and because it was the great
necessity of my nature to love, I loved you. God knows,
I think there was no other reason. Oh, if Heaven gave
me one idea purer and higher than all the rest, it was
that of the beauty and holiness of marriage! And
though mine was a miserable sacrifice, so great was my
need to live in an atmosphere of love and piety, that I
tried to make a sort of temple of it. It was a wild ruin.
Oh, worse! it was a ridiculous failure! This hour has
proved it. Ha! ha! ha! Hark! did I laugh? No, it was
not I. I have nothing to laugh at in earnest, and I never
laugh in scorn. But there are two spirits in me now,
and one mocks at the other.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sit down, this moment, sit down!” thundered General
Garnet, stamping furiously.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“But heedless as the dead was she</div>
      <div class='line'>Of all around, above, beneath!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Of all but the stormy outpouring of thought and feeling,
from her own over-burdened heart and brain.</p>

<p class='c010'>“When you trampled all my rights and my happiness
beneath your feet, when you seized and married me
against my will, I excused you, for I said you loved me
with a strong passion, and strong passions have their
necessities and their rights. When you required me to
give up my dearest friends, and lay aside habits of study
and elegant amusements, that were a second nature to
me, I said that your position gave you a right to dictate
to me, and I acquiesced without a murmur. When you
took my little child away from me, the only comfort I
had left in the world, and sent her across the ocean, to
remain at school for many years, I said you were her
father, and what you did was doubtless intended for her
good, however mistaken the intention might be, and I
submitted. Recently, when you have laid violent hands
upon my person, and endangered my life, I said it was
violence of temper, not malignity of heart, and I resolved,
for your sake and mine, to keep our secret, and
to bear with it. I excused it—nay, I went farther, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>vindicated it. No ill-usage, from mere violence of temper,
could have affected my happiness. I do not know
but that I thought you had a right to strike me if you
were angry. Because I was superstitious and fanatical,
and because I loved you then. They say that ‘perfect
love casteth out fear.’ My love, imperfect as it was, cast
out fear. When I conscientiously assisted at Elsie’s
marriage, and remained home here to meet you, I nerved
my heart to bear all your fury. I even said it would be
just, coming from you. And no matter how much I had
suffered at your hands, no matter if you had left me for
dead, as you did once before, if I had recovered I could
have gone on cheerily with my daily duties, as if nothing
had happened. Because I could have understood
violence, as I said: I could have understood anything
that grew out of heat of passion—anything, but this
clear-headed, cold-blooded treachery—because I loved
you then. Nay! My God! I believe in my soul, I love
you yet, and it is that which stings my self-respect to
madness. It is that which lays my soul open to the entrance
of the scornful, jibing spirit that mocks at my
holiest instincts.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sit down! Sit down, I say!” vociferated General
Garnet, striding toward her.</p>

<p class='c010'>Suddenly she fell at his feet, and raised her clasped
hands, saying:</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am mad! I am mad! Two spirits possess me—a
mad and a sane one. It is the mad spirit that impels me
to say now—while your serpent-treachery folds its cold,
damp coils about my heart, and not so much stings as
chills me to death—to say now, in the face of all reason—while
the same spirit keeps before me—to say, only
forgive Elsie! only be reconciled with her, and take all
the rest; and I will try to forget that I have been deceived
and scorned. At least I will never, never harbor
the thought, much less give it expression again. Come,
forgive your child! You cannot be forever obdurate to
your child! Be reconciled to her, and I will believe that
anger and disappointment bereft you of your reason—for
a little while—and that it was only during a temporary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>fit of insanity that you could have done such a thing.
And I will honor you again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Pooh! fudge! You are not so mad as to believe the
words you are saying,” said General Garnet, jerking her
up and flinging her upon the sofa. “There, be quiet;
I hate raving. And now listen to what I have to say in
regard to Elsie: I will never see her, or speak to her,
or receive a letter or a message from her, under any circumstances
whatever, so long as I live. I will never
permit you to see her, or speak to her, or hold any communication,
by letter or message, with her, under any
circumstances that may occur, so long as you live. I
will never give her an acre of land, or a cent of money,
or an article of food, or raiment, or fuel, to save her
from starvation or freezing!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Alice, exhausted, prostrate, gazed at him in horror, as
with a darkened and ferocious countenance, and a voice
of concentrated hatred, so deep as to be nearly inaudible,
he continued:</p>

<p class='c010'>“If she were to dare to set foot upon this plantation
I would loosen my bloodhounds upon her!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Fiend—you are the only bloodhound that would hurt
her. Turn them loose on her, then—do it! They would
crouch at her feet! They would lick her hands—her
beautiful hands—that have fed and caressed them all.
Or get strange dogs to hunt her with, and even they
would grovel before the angel in her eyes. Oh, fool!—you
are the only brute on God’s creation that would harm
her,” said Alice, in a low, deep tone.</p>

<p class='c010'>General Garnet continued, as if he had not heard
her:</p>

<p class='c010'>“If she were lying, dying, at my gate I would not
suffer one of my negroes to hand her a drink of water,
if that drink of water would save her from death!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Demon—there is not a man, woman, or child on this
plantation that you could hinder, with all your malice
and power, from rendering Elsie any service she might
require—unless you imprisoned them, or tied them hand
and foot!” said Alice, in a dying voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>Still he continued, without attending to her indignant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>but faint interruptions. And his face became still more
dark and demoniac.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And now comes the very best part of the argument,
which, like a good orator, I have saved for the very
last—I wonder how you will like it! I shall take pleasure
in watching the play of your pretty features while
I tell you, and dissecting and analyzing the emotions of
your heart as you hear! And saying within myself—there
is so much regret, and there is so much shame,
and there is so much jealousy, and there is so much rage.
Listen, then—you have disappointed me in my first plan
for uniting two great estates. Before I have done I will
make you regret that. The estates shall be united yet.
You have taught your daughter to disobey me. Very
well; you have bereft her of her birthright for a caress,
to your shame be it remembered—and I have discarded
and disowned her. But, listen: I have another daughter—the
child of my love—ha!—are you pale with jealousy?
Listen, farther yet: all the broad lands of Mount
Calm that came by you, and should descend to your
child, and enrich her, will I bestow upon the child of my
love; and her hand will I bestow upon Lionel Hardcastle,
who will be glad to accept it, no doubt. Ha!
Now die of rage!” he exclaimed, with a ferocious laugh.</p>

<p class='c010'>But neither regret, shame, nor jealousy, nor rage, disfigured
that peaceful face, or agitated that composed
figure. General Garnet, who glanced at her first in triumph,
now gazed in awe. Her eyes were closed, her
hands had fallen. Her whole figure expressed perfect repose.
She looked as if the Angel of Death had laid
hand upon her head, and said to that storm-tossed life,
“Peace—be still.” “And there had fallen a Great
Calm.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At break of day a large traveling wagon, strongly
and compactly built, and neatly roofed with snow-white
tent-cloth stretched lightly over hoops, and drawn by two
stout gray mules, stood before the village hotel at Huttontown.
This wagon was closely packed with a small
assortment of cabin furniture. All this “household
stuff” was perfectly new, clean, neat, and bright, and
snugly stowed away in the back and middle part of the
wagon. Near the front of the vehicle stood a small, flag-bottomed
armchair, wedged tightly in between boxes and
trunks, so that it could not be jostled by the motion of
the wagon. It is needless to say that this was the “traveling
carriage” of our bridal pair, or that the little flag-bottomed
chair was provided for the especial convenience
and comfort of the bride. Early as the hour was,
a crowd of village neighbors had collected for the pleasure
of seeing the “bride and groom” come out, and
the wagon start “for the Western country.” Among
the assembled villagers was a fine, handsome boy of ten
or twelve years of age, who volunteered to hold the reins
until the travelers should come forth.</p>

<p class='c010'>The people had not very long to wait. The front door
of the hotel opened, and Dr. Hardcastle, clad in a large,
shaggy overcoat and overalls, and fox-skin cap and
gloves, and looking as great, energetic, and joyous as
ever, came out, leading Elsie, wrapped in a full, brown
cloth cloak, with her healthful, happy face blooming and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>smiling from out the comfortable rolls of a wadded,
brown silk hood.</p>

<p class='c010'>Magnus nodded and smiled as he shook hands hastily
right and left, and hurried Elsie toward the wagon. He
lifted her in, fixed her comfortably in her chair, wrapped
the ample folds of her cloak about her, and tucked it
snugly around her feet, with a solicitous care for her and
a total indifference to the eyes of the lookers-on that
provoked their merriment into peals of good-humored
laughter, accompanied by exclamations of: “That is
right, doctor. Take good care of her, God bless her!
That’s right, doctor. That’s the way. Tuck her up
warm. Indeed, her chin will freeze, if you don’t muffle
that comforter closer around her throat.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, hurry! let’s escape this!” whispered Elsie, laughing
and blushing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Never mind, dear! Never mind their rough manners.
You are too generous and large-hearted to feel anger or
contempt at their unrefined method of expressing their
sympathy, which is really more sincere and earnest than
all the congratulations in elegant phrases that ladies and
gentlemen give and receive upon such occasions. Let us
have patience with uncultivated Nature, dear Elsie, for
we are going to live with her a long time. At least, have
any other feeling for humanity rather than contempt,
dear Elsie,” replied Magnus, as he finished arranging
her cloak.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Me! me presume to feel contempt for my rough, honest,
kindly neighbors! Oh, Magnus, never! I will prove
to you that I do not!” exclaimed Elsie, in a low, hurried
voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then Magnus sprang into his seat, and took the reins
from the hands of the lad.</p>

<p class='c010'>As he gave them up, the boy fixed a long, lingering,
wistful look at the wagon and its occupants.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You look as if you had half a mind to accompany us,
my boy,” said Dr. Hardcastle, as he read the expression
of the lad’s countenance.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I have, sir! for I feel I could be useful, almost
necessary to you, and beneficial to myself, if I could go;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>but I cannot, for I have a little girl to take care of at
home.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A little girl to take care of? You!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir, my little sister, or rather she is just like my
little sister. We live on Hutton Island.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, yes! the two Children of the Isle. How come
you over here so early, my boy?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I came over to bring some maninosies to the tavern,
sir, in time for them to be prepared for breakfast. I
expect you ate some of them yourself, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, and they were very good.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My sister and I gathered them, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes. Well, my boy, you look like a fine, independent,
enterprising lad. Rely on God and yourself, improve
your mind, be honest, industrious, and frugal, and
you will make your own way in the world. What is your
name?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hugh Hutton, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, young Hutton of the Isles, one of the ‘Scotch
lairds,’ as the people used to call them for their pride
and——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Poverty,” calmly concluded the boy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, child, they go admirably together. Hold to
your pride as long as you are poor, and cast it away when
you become rich. Well, Hugh, I will not forget you, or
lose sight of you. Some day I shall come back, and
then you may return with me. Good-by,” said Dr.
Hardcastle, shaking hands with the boy.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then he arose in his seat, lifted his cap, and waved
farewell to the neighbors. Elsie kissed her hand to them
several times, blushing brightly as they all waved their
hats and handkerchiefs, and amid the cheers and benedictions
of the little crowd the wagon started.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We must make thirty miles to-day, dear Elsie, and
reach Deep Dell by nightfall if possible,” said Magnus.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, how I wish that fine boy were really with us.
How useful he could be to you, and what a man you
could make of him!” said she, looking back to where
Hugh stood, the last of the crowd, watching the departing
wagon.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>“God has made a man of him already, dear Elsie.
What a fine, independent look he has! Yes, I could have
wished him to go with us; a very strong sympathy attracts
me to that boy. I should be very proud of that
boy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He will be gentle and great like you. He reminds
me of what you were at his age, when you used to carry
me about the forest in your arms, as joyous as a boy,
yet as careful as a woman. I thought of that when he
talked about his sister. Magnus, I used to feel as if I
should so love to have a sister or to be a sister. There is
such a sweet and tender thought in sisterhood—children
of the same mother. Just now I thought that boy’s
voice took a tone of modulated sweetness when he spoke
of his sister. Yet his very gentleness must be the playfulness
of a lion’s cub—there is such fire in his grand
eyes, that reminded me of you, too. Oh, Magnus, do
you know what I have been thinking of? what great
music has been sounding its majestic harmony through
my soul this morning as I journey by your side into the
wilderness? Listen:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Thy spirit, Independence, let me share,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Lord of the lion heart and eagle eye!</div>
      <div class='line'>Thy steps I follow with my bosom bare,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Nor heed the storm that howls along the sky.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“And I feel as if you were that very incarnate spirit of
Independence, and I am sure that that boy was the worshiping
disciple who was ready to follow you. And as
for me, Magnus,” she continued, laughing, “there is such
a superfluous amount of energy in my little body and soul
this morning, that I feel as if I could not only brave and
bear hardships and peril by your side, but should be disappointed
if they did not come.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have so much resistance, Elsie! but do not do
with your wealth of energy as the prodigal son did with
his wealth of money, spend it all at the outset; and, as
an illustration of what I mean, put your hands within
your cloak, and fold it closely around your chest—we
are about to turn and face a sharp, if not a violent northwester,
and after the sun is fully up you will see that it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>will blow harder,” said Magnus, as they turned the end
of the street and entered the turnpike road.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a glorious winter day; the sun now arose in
cloudless splendor, lighting up the snow-clad hills and
plains and ice-spangled forest trees and bushes into
flashing, dazzling radiance, while far away behind them
dashed and sparkled the green waters of the Chesapeake,
like a sea of molten emeralds.</p>

<p class='c010'>Their road, after leaving the village, lay over the snowy
hills and plains, and through the forest around the base
of Mount Calm. In making the circuit they once came
in full view of the front of the mansion house, and Elsie,
seizing her husband’s arm, exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Magnus, tie your pocket-handkerchief at the end of
your stick, and get up and wave it. I know that our beloved
mother has been watching at that window for the
last hour to see us pass. I know it, though it is too
distant to see her distinctly; yet I think I see somebody
there. Wave it, Magnus, and then we’ll know.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Dr. Hardcastle stood up, lifted the impromptu flag on
high, and presently the signal was returned by a white
cloth waved from the window, and instantly withdrawn.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She saw us, she saw us, Magnus! But stay! why
didn’t she look out?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It would not have been safe on such a sharp morning
as this for your mother to run her head out of the window
in that bleak, exposed position,” said Magnus, repressing
the various vague forebodings of his heart.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am afraid something has happened to mother, Magnus.
Oh! indeed, I feel as if something had,” said Elsie
anxiously.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nonsense, my love. I saw some of the gentlemen
who were there last night until twelve, and who slept at
the hotel, and one of them told me when I inquired,
that all the family were well. However, Elsie, in driving
around we will see some of the colored folks, and receive
fresh assurance. Elsie, dear, it is solely on your mother’s
account that I do not turn into the grounds and drive up
to the mansion house now, and make a last effort at
reconciliation with your father. I know, Elsie, that it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>would only subject her to a violent and perhaps fatal
scene. I know, poor child, that it is a great trial to you
to pass by your father’s house, bound for a long journey,
and a new, strange life, without stopping to ask his blessing.
Oh! I know it, my poor Elsie! but keep your courage;
this is the sharpest, and it is also the last trial you
shall have.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, my courage is up,” said Elsie, dashing the sparkling
tears from her eyes, and smiling out like an April
sun from the clouds. “These, father, are the very last
tears I am going to shed. No, indeed, won’t I weep, and
make you sad for me, my dear Magnus! No, indeed,
won’t I, for anybody’s cruelty and injustice!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hush, hush, my darling! ‘The heart grows bitter by
saying bitter things,’” said Magnus, kissing the dew-drops
from her rosy cheek.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gee up, Dobbin! Make them gee up, Magnus,” said
Elsie, poking at the mules with the point of her umbrella.</p>

<p class='c010'>Magnus put whip to the animals, and they started
afresh. Soon, in turning around toward the back of
Mount Calm, they came to a group of negroes just starting
to their work. Every man of them dropped his hat,
and stood bowing, smiling, and grimacing at the sight of
their young mistress. Magnus stopped the wagon.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How are they all at the house, Uncle Bob?” he asked
of the driver.</p>

<p class='c010'>“All fus’ rate, sir! ’Deed dey is, Miss Elsie, honey.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you sure that mother is quite well, Bob?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“’Deed, fus’ rate, Miss Elsie! ’Deed is her, honey!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How do you know, Uncle Bob? You never go to the
house.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“’Deed, honey, sister Milly told me; ’deed, honey, you
needn’t be ’t all oneasy, nor likewise ’stress in your mind
’bout your ma! De madam is fus’ rate—’deed her is.
Der wa’n’t nothin’ of no fuss, nuther, honey!—eberyting
passed off quite quiet. Marse Iron he had some company
las’ night, and ’joyed himself ’long o’ de gemmen
very much.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It is unnecessary to say that “Iron” was the negro
corruption of Aaron, and not an unapt translation, either.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>“And mother is well and cheerful?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“High! what I tell you, Miss Elsie? Think I gwine
to ax you a lie? De madam is fus’rate!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank Heaven, then! Here, Bob, here is a keepsake
for you. It is a little prayer-book that I have carried in
my pocket ever since I first left home for England. I
held it in my hand when I was married, and I intended
to carry it out West with me; but here, you shall have it.
And, Bob, give my love to mother, and tell her that I am
very happy—you hear, Bob?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, miss.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And give her this letter also, Bob,” said Dr. Hardcastle,
taking one ready sealed and directed from his
pocket.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then they took leave of the colored folks, shook hands
with Uncle Bob, and started. Again Elsie called the
driver back.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, be sure to tell my dear mother that she must
not have a thought or a care for me. Tell her I am very
happy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, Miss Elsie; yes, honey; I’ll be sure to tell her—’deed,
God A’mighty knows will I. Good-by! God bless
you, Miss Elsie, and you, too, Marse Magnet! I wishes
you both all the good luck in the worl’—’deed I does,
children!—’deed, God A’mighty knows does I—I don’t
care what ole marse say!”</p>

<p class='c010'>And Uncle Bob hurried off after his staff of workmen,
leaving the wagon pursuing its way.</p>

<p class='c010'>Suddenly, with one of his impetuous bursts of emotion,
Magnus threw his arms around the form of his
bride, and drew her to his bosom, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Elsie! every now and then I realize, with a sort
of quick, sharp, almost mortal pang of joy, that you really
are my wife! Oh, Elsie, my love! my child! there lives
not a being on earth so happy as I! There lives not a
creature in heaven so happy as I!”</p>

<p class='c010'>And she sank upon his bosom, pale, faint, with excess
of joy. The reins were loosed, the mules came to a
standstill on the decline of the hill, when Elsie, with one
of her sudden, healthful rebounds from the bathos of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>sentiment, sprang laughing up, and seizing the reins,
exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gee up, Dobbin! Magnus, why don’t you make
them gee up? We shall not make our thirty miles to-day.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Magnus took the reins from her hands, flourished the
whip, and they set off in earnest, unmindful of a cynical
old negro by the roadside, who, watching them as he
bagged his snow-birds from the trap, said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“The cussed infunnally young fools! I s’pose dey tink
it always gwine be jes’ so! Gor A’mighty help ’em!
Aar, Lor’! der troubles is all afore ’em, like young
bearses!”</p>

<p class='c010'>And they went on, happy, hopeful, confident, and
justly confident; recalling the past with its childish
pleasures, planning for the future, pointing out to each
other familiar places in the forest, and spots associated
with some childish reminiscence—now it was the very
tree where Magnus first took her to gather chestnuts;
now the very dell where he set traps to catch snow-birds
for her; now the thicket where the wild rose-bushes bore
so full in spring; now the glade that was red with strawberries
in May; and so, talking and laughing, hoping
and believing, billing and cooing, our pair of turtledoves
pursued their Westerly flight.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXVII.<br> <span class='large'>DEEP DELL—COUNTRY TAVERN.</span></h2>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Here rustic statesmen talked with looks profound,</div>
      <div class='line'>And news much older than their ale went round.</div>
      <div class='line in40'><i>—Goldsmith.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It was far into the night when they reached Deep Dell,
and put up at the large log tavern that fulfilled the manifold
duties of country store, post office, smithy, meetinghouse,
and hotel, and was consequently a place of great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>bustle, if not business. Here our emigrant pair, by special
favor, were accommodated with the landlady’s own
parlor, and promised a private supper. The tavern was
full of people, for this was mail day, and the post-boy
from Huttontown was expected every moment.</p>

<p class='c010'>Magnus went out to put his wagon under cover, and
to feed and stable his mules.</p>

<p class='c010'>And Elsie sat to employ his absence in writing a few
lines to her mother, which she inclosed and directed to
Mr. Wilson, the young Methodist minister.</p>

<p class='c010'>She had scarcely concluded when supper, consisting of
fine coffee and rich cream, buckwheat cakes, fresh butter,
and venison steaks with currant jelly, was brought in
and neatly arranged upon the table.</p>

<p class='c010'>Magnus came in, and Elsie, with a blush and a smile,
took her seat at the head of the board. This was the
first time she had “done the honors of the table,” and
her half-womanly, half-childly heart was pleased at the
novelty of her position.</p>

<p class='c010'>As for Magnus, he was as gravely comfortable as if he
had been used to his vis-a-vis all his life.</p>

<p class='c010'>Very early the next morning the mules were fed and
watered and put to the wagon, and a substantial breakfast
prepared for our travelers.</p>

<p class='c010'>But when Magnus went to the bar to pay his bill, the
barkeeper, with the slow nonchalance of a country postmaster,
handed him a letter, which he said had been
brought by the Huttontown post-boy late the night previous.
Magnus took the letter. It was superscribed in
the handwriting of Mr. Wilson. He turned it to break
it open, and found, to his dismay, that the seal was black.
He tore it open. It was short, even abrupt in its annunciation.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, why was not this letter given me last night?”
exclaimed Dr. Hardcastle, in strong excitement.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Because, sir, the mail did not get in until an hour
after you had gone to bed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have you any description of carriage here, lighter

<p class='c010'>“I hope there’s no bad news, sir?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes—my wife’s mother died yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good Heaven, sir; was the poor lady sick when you
left?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, no—it was unexpected—quite suddenly; we left
her in perfect health. Is there any vehicle I can procure?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, sir—dear me, this is very shocking; I am very
sorry to hear it. Yes, there’s Mrs. Barber—her old
carryall.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have my mules put to it on the instant,” said Magnus;
and pale with trouble, he went into the little breakfast
parlor where Elsie sat at the head of the breakfast
table awaiting. His grave demeanor, his troubled face,
and the open letter with the broken black seal, alarmed
her. Starting up in haste, she rushed to his side. He
threw his arms around her, and placed the letter in her
hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>Elsie read the first lines. She was too strong and full
of blood to faint, but the strength and sanguinity that
kept her from falling under the sudden, tremendous blow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>gave greater energy and passion to her grief. Breaking
from her husband’s arms, with a wild shriek she gave
herself up to passionate lamentations and bitter self-reproaches.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should not have left her—I should not have left
her! Oh! I see now, it was thoughtless—it was selfish—it
was cruel to leave her! If I could scarcely bear my
father’s tyranny, how could she? How could she—so
delicate, so sensitive! Died suddenly!—oh, yes, done to
death—done to death! And to keep it secret for four
or five hours—oh!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Elsie—dear, darling Elsie—hush! Do not say bitter
and sinful things, which you will repent.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, don’t put your arms around me, Magnus! It
would be heinous for me to be loved, or comforted by
your sympathy, now. I who left my gentle, fragile
mother alone, to be done to death for me; my dove-like
mother, in the claws of the vulture. I, who was so much
stronger, and who, having your protection also, should
have remained to protect her. I to leave her, defenseless,
and in peril for my sake, and to come flaunting off,
so happy and thoughtless, like a very matron. Oh, Magnus,
I could go to a nunnery, Magnus—I could go to
a nunnery, Magnus. A hundred serpents are gnawing
at my heart! Oh, Magnus, I can never be happy—never
make you happy in this world again. Oh, Magnus, I am
sorry—so sorry for you, too! You did not deserve a
sorrow-stricken, remorseful wife. Oh, mother, dear,
gentle mother, what harm did your innocent life do to
anyone, that it should have been trampled out?”</p>

<p class='c010'>And then she burst into tears—such copious tears,
such floods of tears, as only one of her strong and sanguine
temperament could have shed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Tears and lamentations are the natural vent of a
healthful sorrow. It is only the sorrow unto death that
is mute and dry.</p>

<p class='c010'>And while she was drowned in tears, and wringing
her hands, and wailing, and talking, Magnus walked up
and down the floor, waiting as patiently as he would
have waited for a storm of thunder, lightning, and rain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>to subside, except when some unfilial expression of bitter
indignation against her father would escape her lips,
when he would go up to her, and gently risk to stop her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dear Elsie, you must not speak so. Nothing that
your father can do or say to me, or to others, can affect
your duty toward him. Elsie, you must speak of your
father with respect, or not speak of him at all. That is
what your sainted mother would have advised, and, gentle
as she was, enforced. There was nothing more admirable
in Alice Garnet’s blameless character and conduct
than the delicate reserve with which she concealed
her own sufferings, and the gentle dignity with which
she constrained the respect of all her friends for General
Garnet. I often compared her to the dove, folding her
wing over her mortal wound, to hide it from all eyes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Blessed mother!—oh, angel mother!” said Elsie,
bursting into fresh floods.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She respected the husband in General Garnet—will
you not respect the father?” at last said Magnus.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, yes—yes, I will, indeed! I will never say another
word about him. If I do, stop me—don’t let me,
please, Magnus. I don’t wish to do wrong; but, oh,
Magnus, is it not enough to try one’s faith—to kill one’s
faith—when one so good as my mother is permitted to
suffer and to die?” exclaimed Elsie, giving way to another
extravagant burst of sorrow.</p>

<p class='c010'>Magnus knelt by her side, and took her hands, and
stroked her hair, and wiped her tears, until the fresh gush
of grief had spent itself, and then he said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dear Elsie, it is the great strengthener and supporter
of faith—the sufferings and premature death of the good.
It makes immortality, heaven, certain, because necessary;
and necessary, because just. Dear Elsie, what is
the life and death of Christ intended to teach? What is
the resurrection and ascension intended to insure?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know—oh, I know she is an angel in heaven; but
heaven itself needs ‘familiarizing’ to our feelings, before
it can console us for the lost—much.”</p>

<p class='c010'>At this moment the barkeeper came in, and said that
the carryall was ready. Dr. Hardcastle re-arranged the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>cloak around his almost helpless companion, tied her
hood, and leading her out, fixed her in the back of the
carryall.</p>

<p class='c010'>Three o’clock came, and they had still fifteen miles to
go. The mules went in a fast trot. Four o’clock came,
and ten miles lay before them. Five o’clock came; it was
nearly dark, and they were still several miles from town.
At length, at a little before six, when it was quite dark
and piercing cold, they entered Huttontown.</p>

<p class='c010'>Elsie had long in silence given up the hope of getting
even to the church in time for the funeral service there;
and now she whispered, in a low, solemn, sorrow-fraught
tone:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Drive to the church—to the house of the sexton. We
must see her again, if only in the vault.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It will be too much for you, oh, my Elsie!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, no; I entreat, I implore you, take me to the
vault.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>A silent drive of about half an hour’s length brought
them to the deep and sheltered forest dell in which St.
John’s Church stood. Surrounding the dell was the
boundless forest, whose nearer trees stood up, stark and
black, in strong contrast with the snow. Within the circle
of these grim trees gleamed a single ray of red light,
shooting in a line of crimson across the graveyard.
This came from the window of the old sexton’s log house,
that stood just within the shelter of the forest. Taking
this ghostly light as their guide, and picking their way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>cautiously and reverently among the tombs, they approached
the lone dwelling. As they drew near they saw
the light flitting backward and forward in the house, and
then perceived an old negro with a saddled mule at the
gate.</p>

<p class='c010'>Before Dr. Hardcastle could speak to ask a question
the door of the house was opened, and the old sexton
came forth, clad in a shaggy overcoat, fox-cap, and fur
gloves, and carrying a lantern in his hand. Seeing two
strangers, he made an exclamation of surly surprise, and
asked their business. Dr. Hardcastle drew him apart,
explained to him who they were, and what they wanted.
The old man then changed his tone, invited them into his
house, and, lantern in hand, slowly led the way. With
plain kindness, he took the hand of Elsie, and led her
to a rude armchair in the chimney corner, telling her
that, being about to go away for the night, he had put
out the fire, but that he would soon kindle it up again
to warm her. Then going to an obscure corner of the
room, he brought forth a quantity of oily pine knots, and
lighting one at the candle in the lantern, and placing it
on the hearth and piling other around it, and heaping
more upon them, in an instant he had a very hot fire.
Then he turned to Dr. Hardcastle, begging him to be
seated, and explained that he had just been summoned
away to Green Mills to see his brother, who was dangerously
ill; that he had therefore to depart on the instant,
lest he should not see his brother alive; that if Dr. Hardcastle
would dispense with his services, and take the keys
of the church and let himself in, he would be very much
obliged; farther, that if Dr. Hardcastle should choose
not to return to Huttontown in the severe cold, this
poor cottage was at his service, with all it contained; only
when the doctor left, would he please to put out the fire,
and lock up everything, both at the church and at the
cottage, securely, and put the bunch of keys under the
stone by the doorstep. Dr. Hardcastle thanked him,
accepted the keys, promised security to all things intrusted
to his care, and even hastened to dismiss the old
man. When the sexton and the negro had departed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>Magnus turned to Elsie, who had sat all this time in the
armchair by the chimney corner, with her face covered
by the flap of her cloak, and whispered:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Elsie, my dear, dear girl, pause, think; do not insist
upon going into the vault!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, yes! yes, I entreat you; something in my heart
urges me beyond the possibility of keeping back; haste!
haste, I implore you. I am sick with impatience while
you hesitate. I feel as if something momentous, something
tremendous hung upon this instant of time; haste,
haste!” she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My darling, my poor darling, strong as you are, this
has been too much for you; you are nervous, excited,
flighty; but, come along; I can take care of you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Elsie arose and took his arm, and solemnly and silently
they passed out of the old sexton’s house, and took their
mournful way toward the church. Solemnly and silently
they entered its portals, and, dimly lighted by the lantern,
passed up its shadowy aisles—silently, but for the mournful
echo of their footsteps. The door of the vault was
situated at the side of the altar. Opening this door with
reverential care, and still bearing the lantern, Magnus
Hardcastle descended, followed by Elsie, pale with grief
and awe, into its shadows. There is a depth of solemnity
about the last resting-place of the dead which overwhelms
the wildest sorrow with awe, and subdues it into
deathlike stillness. Magnus and Elsie entered the vault
with profound calmness. But here was only the darkness
and repose of death. The vault, like the church, was
new. Only two mortals—an aged man and an infant—had
been placed there to rest, just before Alice Garnet
fell asleep and was laid by their side. As the two mourning
pilgrims entered, the light of the lantern partially revealed
the new, gray stone walls, the white ground floor,
and the three coffins. That of Alice was, of course, easily
recognized. Reverently, mournfully, they approached
and knelt by its side. With reverent hands Magnus
raised the top of the outer case.</p>

<p class='c010'>A glass-plate set in the lid of the coffin gave the features
of the quiet face once more to the view of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>mourning son and daughter. There was the face, even
as Elsie had seen it often in its natural sleep; only more
serene than in slumber, for in her life the very sleep of
Alice had seemed troubled or too deathlike. Was this
repose deathlike? Was this death? Beautiful, strangely
beautiful, was that heavenly face, in its deep repose, in
its rapt repose, for there was a look of ecstasy in the
countenance, in the elastic fullness of the muscles, in the
faint color on the rounded cheeks, and the full and pouting
lips. Was this death? Someone’s reverence for the
beautiful had left the amber ringlets straying from the
close border of the cap, and now so lifelike looked the
lovely face, and these ringlets seemed to tremble as with
a trembling breath. Was this death? Was the suddenness
with which life had left the clay the cause of this
lifelike look? There are moments when the most rational
have wild hopes, moments when the most habitually
self-collected doubt the evidence of their own senses;
it was thus in amaze that they gazed upon her countenance,
seemingly instinct with life; with the freshness,
and fullness, and bloom of life; the color seemed brightening
upon her cheeks and lips with life; the eyelashes
and the amber ringlets seemed quivering with life, and
even as they gazed with amaze the view was obscured by
a mist on the glass, and the beautiful countenance veiled
from their eyes. Elsie spoke with a voice full of tears.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Magnus! dear Magnus! wipe off the glass. Our
breath, as we looked too close, has dulled it. I cannot
see her angel face any longer for the mist upon the
glass.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Magnus drew out his silk pocket-handkerchief and
wiped the glass carefully.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I cannot see her yet, Magnus. I cannot see her yet.
Oh, I want to see her again, that that divine countenance
may be indelibly fixed in my memory—oh-h-h!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Magnus wiped the glass again very carefully, looked,
wiped it a third time most carefully, and, taking up the
lantern, threw its whole light upon the plate, rubbing it
assiduously as he did so. Why did Dr. Hardcastle start—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“As if the Archangel’s trump he heard?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>The new mist upon the glass was from within the coffin.
To snatch a hunting-knife from his belt, to wrench open
the coffin lid with one wrench of his strong hand and
throw it off, to give her fresh air; to snatch her from the
coffin to the warmth and shelter of his living arms and
bosom; to turn to the thunder-stricken Elsie, and exclaim:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Elsie, don’t faint! Be strong, I command you! Your
mother lives! she lives! She has been placed here in apparent
death only; she must not recover to find herself
in this dreadful place; to see these grave-clothes; to
know what horrors have befallen her, lest reason be
shocked forever from its seat. Give me your cloak, Elsie!
Quick! quick! My God, don’t faint, I abjure you; I’ll
never forgive you if you faint now. Your cloak, I say;
your cloak, quick! to throw around this shroud, which
she must not see.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Elsie, with pallid lips and dilated eyes, too amazed and
doubtful of her own senses and sanity to receive the
joyful truth, with mechanical promptitude threw off her
cloak and handed it to Magnus.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s my brave girl; that’s my pioneer wife!” he
said, receiving the cloak, and folding it hastily yet carefully
around the form he held in his arms, and pressing
it closer to his bosom. “There, Elsie! Now, my little
heroine, shade the lantern; quick, Elsie, lest she open
her eyes and see the place we bear her from. Quick,
Elsie! she is moving restlessly in my arms now, and her
form is getting warm, thank Heaven! as warm almost as
yours, my Elsie. There, now follow me closer behind,
Elsie, my little soldier, and you may let the lantern shine
as soon as we get out of the church.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And so, folding the form of Alice closer in his sustaining
arms, closer to his sheltering bosom, and followed
by Elsie, bearing the darkened lantern, he hurried
up the stairs of the vault, down the aisle of the church,
out of the great door, and across the graveyard toward
the cottage of the sexton, never pausing in his speed until
he reached the door of the cabin, which, without stopping
to unlatch, he pushed open with a blow of his foot.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>He bore her in, followed by Elsie with the lantern.
The fire they had left there was still burning brightly,
warming and lighting the whole room. In the upper
end of the apartment stood a poor but neat and cleanly
bed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Toward this he hastened with the form of Alice. He
turned down the cover, and, hastily divesting her of the
heavy cloak, laid her in the bed and covered her warmly
up. He stooped and looked at her with intense interest,
then took her arm and felt her pulse. It was moderately
full and quick. He gazed upon her face. The color was
still brightening in her cheeks and lips; her eyelids were
quivering as if about to fly open; her full, fresh lips
were slightly apart, as if about to speak; she was moving
gently, breathing softly, murmuring melodiously. He
bent his ear to catch that low, musical murmur; low and
musical as the faintest breath of the Æolian harp. The
words of that strange melody were: “Oh, angels, let me
go! I—only I of all the earth love him well enough to
be the instrument of Christ for his redemption—I—only
I of all the earth have faith in its possibility.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wandering, flighty, delirious,” said Dr. Magnus,
quietly dropping the wrist he had held, and rising and
going toward Elsie. “Elsie, I dare not leave your
mother for an instant now. Pick up your cloak, wrap
yourself well in it, take the lantern and haste to the gate,
where we left the carriage; take my medicine chest from
the box, and bring it hither. Haste, Elsie, haste! Every
second counts a year of life.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mechanically as an automaton Elsie had obeyed his
every direction. She looked unnatural with her pale face
and great, dilated eyes. And she performed her part
with the abstracted air and literal and mathematical precision
of a sleep-walker. With this strange, absent air
she went out, and after an absence of about fifteen minutes
returned with the medicine chest.</p>

<p class='c010'>Magnus heard her coming and left his patient for an
instant to open the door and relieve her of her burden.
But here another subject unexpectedly arrested his attention
and claimed his care. As she gave the chest into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>his hands she stared straight at him—straight through
him and past him with such unconscious eyes that he
grew alarmed for her. Setting down the medicine chest
upon a bench, he took her hands and drew her up to the
fire, and, laying his hand upon her shoulder, and looking
straight in her eyes, he said cheerfully:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wake up, Elsie! Rouse yourself, my child! This is
very awful, but not unnatural.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh-h-h!” sighed Elsie, dropping into the armchair.
“Oh-h-h! I know it is not unnatural, or uncommon,
either, for loved ones to die, and hearts to be bereaved
and broken; but, dear Magnus, I am afraid I am going
crazy; I am afraid to tell you what I wildly imagined just
now, what an extravagant fancy I took into my head.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What was it, then?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, don’t be too much astounded at my folly, dear
Magnus, for I have been so grievously tried.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What was it, then? Quick! I have no time for idle
talk.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, then, I fancied—oh-h-h! such a mad, frenzied
fancy—that my beloved mother was alive again. Am I
not going mad? I thought my dear mother was alive
again!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And you know she is!” he exclaimed, dropping his
hand upon her shoulder, with hearty, kindly roughness;
“you know she is! Rouse yourself this moment, Elsie;
I command you; collect your thoughts; remember where
you are, and what has occurred. What sort of behavior
is this? Have I been premature and too partial in ascribing
to you strength of mind; courage, coolness,
promptitude in emergency? Can I depend upon you in
extremity? Come out of this amazement this instant,
Elsie! Wake up, and make yourself useful; weakness
is meanness. Be strong; strength is grandeur. Be
heroic; strength is heroism. Make me proud to call you
wife. Stand up, now; give me both your hands. Look
me straight in the eyes, and let me see if I cannot infuse
some sanity and strength into that amazed and fainting
soul of yours.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Elsie placed the back of her hands against her brow,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>while she slowly arose to her feet, and then, slowly
throwing off her hands, as if to dispel an illusion, she
said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“There; the cloud has passed, Magnus; the weakness
has left me; I will be worthy of you. What is it that I
can do, Magnus?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There! I know you were not a poltroon; only a
fatigued hero, Elsie. Come, one kiss, and then to work.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And he caught her to his bosom with an ardent clasp
and fervent kiss, that inspired from his own rich and
strong vitality all her life, and warmth, and energy, and
activity that her weaker nature needed at this trying moment.
Then he led her to the bedside of her mother,
whispering as he did so:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, my own heroic wife, no relapse into weakness.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, no, indeed, my strength; I will be worthy of you.
Oh, Magnus, I think you have life enough to raise me
from the dead, if I were to die. Oh, Magnus, I begin to
realize now that she lives, and that I am blessed; blessed
to the fullness of content,” said Elsie, sinking upon her
knees and raising her clasped hands and streaming eyes
to heaven.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Calmly, calmly, my Elsie,” said Magnus, laying his
hand gently on her head. “There, rise now, and sit
beside your mother, and watch her, and listen for her
words, that we may know the nature of her illusion, and
not rudely shock it. She seems in a happy trance now—and
her pulse is good, yet her state is so critical that her
waking must be watched for.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hush-h-h! her lips move! she speaks!” said Elsie,
bending over her. “Oh, mother! mother! darling
mother! warm and living, restored to me! What shall I
render Heaven in exchange for thee? Hush-h-h! she is
saying something. Oh, Magnus, that look of quiet
ecstasy has left her countenance, and the troubled, earthly
look she used to wear has come again! What is the
reason of it? oh, what is the reason of it? Oh, see how
her brow contracts! how her lips quiver! Oh, see her
hands fly together and clasp like vises! Oh, Magnus!
Magnus do something! She is going into a spasm.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>“No, no, child; she is not. Natural life is coming
again. Her mind is taking up the train of thoughts at
the place where it was lost. Nothing can be done as yet,
but to listen—yes, listen—she speaks again—hear!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Forgive Elsie—only forgive Elsie, and I will forget
that I have been betrayed, and scorned, and trampled
under foot. At least I will never, never speak of it,” murmured
Alice, in a heart-broken tone; and then her hands
flew up, her eyes flew open, and she looked around in the
full possession of all her faculties, which was evident
from the surprise with which she glanced upon the
strange scene.</p>

<p class='c010'>Magnus and Elsie had drawn back, not to shock her
with their sudden appearance.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yes, catalepsy, epilepsy, apparent death—whatever the
medical faculty in their wisdom might have pronounced
the fit to be that had held her life spellbound for two
days—was over, quite over, and she raised up in the full
possession of all her senses.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where in the universe am I?” she asked, rising upon
her elbow and looking around. “Has he turned me out
of doors, really, and has one of the negroes taken me into
a quarter during a fainting fit? Let me recollect. What
happened after he threw me down? I remember nothing
after that. ‘Now, die of rage’ he said, and spurned me
from him. Yes, that is the last link in memory’s chain.
I must have fainted after that; he must have thrust me
out, and one of the poor negro women must have picked
me up and brought me to her quarters, and here I have
recovered. Oh, I wonder how long I have lain in this
swoon?—not long. It was near daylight when I lost
recollection. It is not quite daylight yet. Oh, I have
not lain here long, perhaps not ten minutes. I wish
someone would come. I want to warn them not to speak
of this. It must not be talked of on the plantation. It
must not get out among the neighbors. And never,
never must Elsie hear of it—guess at it! God! God!
save Elsie from this knowledge! Let her still respect her
father. Let her still be happy in thinking of me in my
home—‘home’—my home. Alas! it is not my home any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>longer! I do not own an interest there—not even a
wife’s interest in the homestead which I should have had,
even had the estate come by General Garnet, for I have
signed even that away—‘all right, title, and interest.’
Yet it is my home, if not my homestead, for it is my husband’s
place of permanent residence, and therefore my
home. And I must go back to it. I must beg him to let
me in. I must, no matter how I may be received. I
must, even if his other daughter is there to insult me. I
must, to spare Elsie the knowledge of this. Elsie must
never know—must never suspect this.” And Alice arose,
and, sitting up straight in bed, prepared to throw the
cover off and arise, when Elsie sprang forward and threw
herself upon the bed, exclaiming, in heart-broken
tones:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Elsie does know it, darling mother. Elsie knows it
all. God nor angels would suffer her to be kept in ignorance
of it—of all the sufferings—of all the sacrifice
that has made it her duty never to leave you nor forsake
you again. And may Heaven forsake me, mother, the
hour that ever I leave you again!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Elsie! good, but rash child, have you ventured
to come back here? Oh, Elsie!” And Alice threw her
arms around the neck of her daughter, and clasped her
to her bosom, and both wept copiously.</p>

<p class='c010'>At last—“Tell me what has happened, dearest child. I
have no recollection of anything since my swoon,” said
Alice, in a faint voice, slipping from the embrace of
Elsie.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mother, darling mother, won’t you please to rest
now, without asking any questions? You must be so
weak,” replied Elsie, laying her gently down, and arranging
the cover over her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I feel weak, yet well, light, renewed; but I won’t ask
questions that will pain you to answer, dear child. I am
almost certain of what has occurred. I swooned, and
was picked up by one of the women and brought to this
quarter, and she sent for you. Dear Elsie, I am afraid
she alarmed you. Did Magnus come, too?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, dearest Mrs. Garnet, I am here,” said Dr. Hardcastle,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>advancing to the bedside with a cordial in his
hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>Elsie raised her mother once more, and taking the restorative
draught, placed it to her lips. Alice drank it,
and then said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Magnus, Elsie, I am afraid they have told you a
dreadful tale of what occurred to me after you left the
house. Dearest, you must not believe all that you may
have heard, and you must excuse the rest. You know
negroes, especially negro women, will exaggerate. They
do not intentionally transcend the truth, but their quick
fancies and warm sympathies lead them into extravagance.
General Garnet, in the temporary insanity of
rage, has done something violent, no doubt; but not so
violent as has appeared to you, and no doubt he regrets
his anger now. Elsie, do not think too hardly of your
father. Give him time. All will come right at last. In
the meanwhile, darling, I must return to the house. I
must not seem inclined to make the most of his anger
by absenting myself. Dearest Elsie, this morning we
must part again. We will take breakfast together in
this humble quarter, and then we must part, dear child,
until better times. You must go with your husband,
Elsie, and I must return to mine,” said Alice, lifting up
her arms and embracing her child.</p>

<p class='c010'>Elsie looked at Magnus in despair. He stooped, and
said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dear Mrs. Garnet, you must sleep now. I am your
physician as well as your son. You must be silent, close
your eyes, and lie still.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I cannot, Magnus. I do not feel the least inclined to
sleep. I feel as though I had had a very long sleep. I
feel quite fresh and renewed, though a little weak, as
from want of nourishment. Besides, day is breaking. It
is time to rise. This is the day you were to depart for
the backwoods, and you intended to have made an early
start. I cannot hinder you. I must rise. We must have
one more social meal together, and then depart to our
several duties.” Alice spoke in a low, calm tone, but
covered her face to conceal the quivering features.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>Magnus seized the chance to draw Elsie aside, to
whisper hurriedly in her ear:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Elsie, she must know all about it. She is strong
enough to bear the knowledge, and so it is perfectly safe
to break it to her gently. In fact, to tell her the truth
is the only safe plan. Her providential recovery from
apparent death must not be made known to anyone for
the present, or until General Garnet’s secret disposition
is ascertained and can be safely trusted. She has nothing
to hope from him; she shall have nothing to fear.
She must be perfectly secure from his persecutions and
annoyances, until he is in a better frame of mind. This
I think the safety of her life and of her reason demands.
I consider that she is providentially dead to General
Garnet and living to us. She must accompany us to the
West. We must be en route within an hour, lest the
old sexton returns and discovers all. Listen, I will go
back to the church and restore everything there to such
complete order that no suspicion shall be excited. And
while I am gone, do you assist her to arise, if she wishes
it. When she gets up and looks about her, she will see
where she is, and that will greatly prepare her for my
explanation. If she asks you any questions refer her to
me alone for explanation. There, love, is the bundle of
clothing you put up in your haste when about to leave
Deep Dell. I brought it from the carriage just now, while
you were talking with your mother. Get your double
wrapper out, and slip it on her before the window-shutter
is opened. I would not have her see that garb suddenly.”
And having given these hasty directions Magnus hurried
out to the chapel, and having restored everything
there to primal order, returned to the cottage. He found
Alice sitting up by the fire with her hands clasped, and
her head bowed with a look of deep thoughtfulness.
Elsie had hung the tea-kettle on to make coffee, and had
set the table, and was now handing out the contents of
the old man’s cupboard.</p>

<p class='c010'>As Dr. Hardcastle entered, Alice, without raising
her head, held out her hand to him, saying:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Magnus, come here. Where am I?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>And Dr. Hardcastle went and drew a chair to her
side, and took her hand, and slowly, and gently, and
cautiously made known to her the events of the last two
days. Alice made no comment.</p>

<p class='c010'>The awful solemnity of the facts disclosed—the apparent
death, the burial, veiled, softened as they were in
the telling—overwhelmed her soul. She dropped her
head upon her open hands, and neither moved nor spoke
for a long time, or until Elsie came to her side, passed one
arm earnestly over her shoulder, placed a cup of coffee
at her lips with the other hand, bending her bright, loving
face smilingly upon her the while. Then Alice lifted
up her head, took the cup, and kissed the gentle hand
that gave it.</p>

<p class='c010'>While Alice drank the coffee Dr. Hardcastle went out
and attended to his mules. When he returned they
all gathered around the breakfast table. It was during
that meal that he proposed to Alice the plan of accompanying
them, urging upon her the strong necessity of
her doing so.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alice combated all his arguments as well as her instincts
taught her.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dr. Hardcastle avowed his intention of accompanying
her back to Mount Calm, and, remaining in the neighborhood,
in case of her perseverance in her present intention
of returning. Alice sought to dissuade him from
that plan.</p>

<p class='c010'>Finally, after much talk, Alice agreed to accompany
them on the first stage of their journey as far as Deep
Dell, and remain there incognito, while he should return
to Mount Calm, and ascertain the disposition of General
Garnet, and, if possible and prudent, break gradually
to him the fact of his wife’s unexpected restoration to
life.</p>

<p class='c010'>Having agreed upon this plan Dr. Hardcastle made
rapid preparations for the recommencement of their
journey. They—he and Elsie—restored everything
about the cottage to complete order; put out the fire,
fastened up the cupboard, and the windows, and then the
doors, and, tying a little purse of money to the door-key,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>by way of compensation for all they had used, hid it
“under the stone by the doorstep,” as requested, entered
the carriage, and commenced their journey.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The little sea-girt homeland of Hutton’s Isle had
never recovered from the fatal devastation of the great
tempest and flood. The fences had never been reconstructed
strong and complete as before. The house had
never been properly repaired. All the little mending
and rebuilding that had been done had been the joint
work of Miss Joe and her factotum, Pontius Pilate. And
these slight repairs were of such a temporary character
as to require renewal every few months. And every year
the house sank and fell, and grew more ruinous and dilapidated.
And every year the isle became more desolate
and desert. Every season the soil was less productive
and the crop poorer. The oyster banks had
failed entirely. The fisheries were becoming precarious.
Nothing remained in primeval abundance except in the
flocks of water-fowl that still flew in vast clouds over the
isle, darkening the very air at certain times, like night
or storm.</p>

<p class='c010'>So much for the house and isle. Now for the inmates
and inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>From having been always poor they were now upon
the verge of penury—destitution. Miss Josephine Cotter,
the good fairy of this sea-girt isle, was, to use her
own expression, growing older and older every day of
her life. She did not know, she said, which was most
likely to topple down first, she or her old house.</p>

<p class='c010'>The death of Pontius Pilate in the beginning of the
winter, and a severe attack of rheumatism in her limbs,
had seemed to be the climax of the poor old lady’s misfortunes.
It was immediately after the burial of Pontius
Pilate that Miss Joe was sitting down in the depth of
despair, with her apron thrown over her head, and her
head bowed upon her knees, Hugh and Garnet suddenly
stood before her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t cry any more, granny. I and Nettie can work
the farm,” said Hugh, in a cheerful, confident tone.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You and Nettie work the farm!” replied Miss Joe,
looking up with pity, anger, and contempt in the expression
of her countenance and in the tone of her voice.
To her, a woman past sixty, the boy of twelve and the
girl of nine seemed yet infants. “You and Nettie work
the farm!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, granny, and haul the wood, and fish, and
shoot——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Pah, pah! Hush talking, you make my head ache.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Granny, I have sometimes taken the plow from Pont
and plowed a row for fun. I know a little practice would
make me perfect at that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Granny, Hugh can hoe up the hills, and I can drop
corn. Hugh can cut wood, and I can fetch and carry it.
And now, as there is no fish near the isle, Hugh can go
out in the boat, and I can go with him to bait his hooks
and look after the basket.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And do you guess all the hard and manifold work
they did?</p>

<p class='c010'>It was the dead of winter—the earth was frozen hard,
and two feet deep with snow, crusted with ice. All the
wood that was burned on the isle had to be cut and
hauled from the forest behind Huttontown, and brought
over to the isle in a boat. And the boy, with no implements
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>but a hatchet, a small wheelbarrow, and a little
rowboat, performed all that labor alone, until one day,
when he had made very slow progress, and effected very
little, he returned home, near frozen, from having been
so long at work in the snow and among the ice-clad trees.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then Nettie threw herself into a violent paroxysm of
excitement, and vowed that she would go with him the
next day to help him gather wood in the forest. And
she went. And while Hugh cut the brush and the
lighter branches of the dead trees Nettie would break
them up and pile them in the wheelbarrow, enlivening
the earnest, thoughtful boy all the time with her wild
and joyous talk.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was late in the afternoon of a stormy day near the
end of December, that the two children, Hugh Hutton
and Garnet Seabright, might have been seen wandering
on the cold, bare, snow-clad northwest beach of Hutton’s
Isle.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hugh was at this time a fine, handsome, athletic boy
of twelve and a half years of age; tall, broad-shouldered,
deep-chested, strong limbed, with the high Roman features,
dark complexion, and commanding countenance
of all his race; a noble boy, undisguised even by the old,
worn, faded, and patched suit of homespun cloth in
which he was clad. Bitterly cold as it was, his head and
feet were bare—bare, because though Miss Joe might
shear the sheep, and card and spin the wool, and knit
him socks enough, yet shoes and hats cost a great deal
more money than Miss Joe or Hugh could often get
together, and so shoes and hats were luxuries and elegancies,
only to be indulged in on Sundays and high
holidays.</p>

<p class='c010'>Garnet Seabright was now about ten years of age;
a beautiful, brilliant, sun-burned, or rather sun-gilded
brunette, whom the sea air and sun rays had made as
hard, bright, dark, and resplendent as the burning,
crimson, sea-coast gem whose name she bore. Child of
Apollo and Amphytrite she was. Her eyes were large,
dark, and burning bright; her rich and glossy hair
seemed jet black in the shade, but emitted gleams of red
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>light wherever the sun shone upon it; her complexion
was rich and glowing; she wore a dress of scarlet country
cloth, with coarse shoes and stockings, and a coarse
straw hat—and, altogether, her bright presence warmed
and illumined the cold, bleak desolation of the sea-coast,
like some cheerful fire. She followed close behind Hugh,
stopping whenever he stopped, and digging with a little
stick wherever the little round holes in the sand indicated
the presence of the maninosies, left by the subsiding
wind and ebbing tide upon the beach. Very necessary
was it that they should fill their basket, for very little
else had they at home for supper.</p>

<p class='c010'>Their task was finished just as the clear, red winter’s
sun sank to a level with the horizon, lighting up all the
bay like a sea of fire.</p>

<p class='c010'>The boy and girl started for home with their baskets
well laden with maninosies, and were gayly laughing
around the fire, when Miss Joe held up her hand, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hush, I thought I heard a man’s step.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A man’s step!” echoed Hugh, with a look of surprise.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A man’s step!” re-echoed Nettie, her eyes wide open
with astonishment.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes! A man’s heavy step crunching through the
snow. There, listen! there it is again. It seems to be
coming up the hill toward the house—listen!”</p>

<p class='c010'>They all listened.</p>

<p class='c010'>Crunch, crunch, crunch came the heavy, regular,
monotonous tramp.</p>

<p class='c010'>And it is impossible to convey the effect of that regular,
heavy sound breaking upon the profound stillness
and solitude of night on that sea-girt isle.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the name of Heaven, who can it be?” exclaimed
Miss Joe, as nearly frightened as ever she was in her
life.</p>

<p class='c010'>Crunch, crunch, crunch came the step, nearing the
door.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am going to see,” exclaimed Hugh, seizing up a
pine knot, lighting it at the fire, and making for the door.</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Joe could scarcely repress a scream.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>Nettie stood like a young panther at bay; clinging to
Miss Joe in terror, yet looking toward the door with her
eyes ablaze with defiance.</p>

<p class='c010'>Just as a loud rap started them afresh Hugh swung
the door open, and a tall, majestic-looking man, wrapped
in a large cloak, strode into the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s godfather! As sure as a gun that’s godfather!”
exclaimed Nettie; making one bound from the
place where she stood to a chair, and springing thence
to the bosom of the newcomer, where she clung desperately,
pressing her arms around his neck; holding his
head between her hands, while she kissed his eyes and
cheeks and lips; then rubbing and rooting her head into
his bosom, and screaming with delight.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And is it possible you recollect me, little Nettie?”
asked General Garnet (for it was he), in a tone of voice
almost sad.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Recollect you, godfather; sure I do! Though you
have been away so long; I haven’t seen you since I was
a wood-sprite, and that was a long time ago, and now
I am a water-nymph,” exclaimed Nettie, rubbing her
head into him, and clinging around him, laughing with
joy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wild as ever, Nettie?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wild, yes! You know when I was a wood-sprite I
could climb trees like a squirrel; well, now, I am a sea-nymph—I
can swim like a duck and dive like a fish—ask
granny if I can’t! cried Nettie, reiterating all her exclamations
of affection and delight, and repeating all her
impetuous caresses.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>“It seems to me that you love me a little, Nettie?”
said he, in the same sad tone.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Love you a little, godfather! Oh! just open your
cloak and take me inside next to you. Oh! just unbutton
your coat, and button me up inside of that, too. I
love you well enough to let you swallow me, godfather,”
exclaimed the imp, nestling close to him with her arms
about his neck, her head tucked into his bosom, and
wriggling with delight.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, you do love me—disinterestedly—poor, forsaken
child! And you are the only thing on earth that
does love me,” said he, folding both arms closely about
her.</p>

<p class='c010'>All this took place in a very few minutes, while Miss
Joe was rising in her corner, setting aside her wheel,
smoothing down her apron, and coming forward to meet
her visitor, saying:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nettie, jump down this moment, and don’t trouble
the ‘gentleman.’” But Nettie clung tighter, and General
Garnet held her closer. “General Garnet, sir, it is
an unexpected honor to see you here. Pray, come to the
fire and sit down. Hugh, shut that door, and set a
chair for the general, and throw more brush on the fire.
General, do sit down, and don’t let that wild child bother
you so. Come down, Nettie, I say.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I sha’n’t, granny!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Never mind, Miss Joe, I like to have her here,” said
General Garnet, throwing off his cloak, seating himself
in a large armchair at the fire, and seating Nettie on his
knee. “Well, my old friend, how does fate use you
nowadays?” he finally asked of the old lady.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, sir, very well, indeed; fust-rate, I thank you,”
answered proud Miss Joe.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am very glad to hear it,” commented her visitor,
with one arm still clasping Nettie, while he glanced sarcastically
around the room.</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Joe did not perceive the irony, but she saw his
suit of deep mourning, and suddenly recollected that she
might be expected to say something appropriate to the
occasion. So, composing her countenance to funereal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>solemnity, she looked at General Garnet, and said, very
seriously, the following commonplace:</p>

<p class='c010'>“We have heard of your heavy bereavement in the
sudden death of your wife, General Garnet, and we are
very much grieved. But you know, sir, death is the common
lot of all. It is the only condition we can—can have
life on. It’s just as nat’ral as being born. And so, sir,
I hope you’ll be able to bear up under your fate like a
philosopher. Besides which, it is the will of God. And
being just so, I trust you will have grace to resign yourself
to your trials like a Christian.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I trust so, I trust so,” replied General Garnet,
speaking quickly; then he added: “It augments my sorrow
very much, however, to remember that it was the
misconduct of the daughter that precipitated the fate of
the mother.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good Heaven! you don’t say so, sir!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes! you may as well know the truth, my good old
friend. Elsie threw herself entirely away; eloped and
went off to the West with that worthless beggar, Hardcastle,”
said he, looking around to see the effect of his
words.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hugh’s head sprang up with an expression of indignant
astonishment, denial, and defiance on his fine countenance.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nettie gazed at him—appalled.</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Joe stared, with mouth and eyes all open with
wonder, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good gracious, sir, you don’t tell me so. I heard
something—but I didn’t—I never—well, dear me—Lord
a-mercy. Was it really that away, arter all?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes: and now my good friend, my excellent friend,
let us change the subject; it is too painful; much too
painful; even you can judge a father’s and a husband’s
feelings must be upon such an occasion. Let us leave
the agonizing topic, and never revert to it again. Let us
turn to a more agreeable subject. My dear little goddaughter,
here,” said he, bending over the child on his
knee with his soft, bright smile—a smile as charming
as full, beautifully curved lips, pearly teeth, and a dark
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>mustache, and the spirit of Belial could make it; “my
dear little godchild here—she is a very fine little girl,
and will one day, no doubt, make a very accomplished
woman. You have taken good care of her; it is easy to
see that. What rosy cheeks she has!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have taken as good care of her as I could, sir—which
being an old woman—too old to follow after children—wan’t
much.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am under great obligations to you, Miss Joe, and
must find some way in which to repay you for the years
of trouble and expense you have been put to upon account
of my little ward.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not at all, sir; you owe me nothing,” said the proud
old lady. “I have always been a-t’iling, striving, saving
soul; but I never saved anything, as I thought anyone
near me, ’specially a little child, was a sufferin’ for. No,
General Garnet, ef I am to be paid at this hour of the
day I had rather the Lord pay me. I don’t want you
to take it out’n his hands.”</p>

<p class='c010'>General Garnet, turning to little Nettie, again took her
hand, looked at the beautifully-molded but sun-browned
thing, and said, softly and smilingly:</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have a very pretty-shaped hand, my dear little
girl. You ought to take care of it. You ought to wear
gloves.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Haint got any, godfather.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But you should get them or have them got for you.
Why don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Couldn’t dig for maninosies or break brush with
gloves on, godfather.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, you don’t do these shocking things?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, indeedy! and I’m going coon hunting with
Hugh next moonshiny night that comes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Next moonlight night that comes you will be in a
very different looking place from this,” said he, pushing
the lurid black ringlets back gently behind her ears, and
noticing for the first time that sure index of “gentle
blood” in human kind or horses—the small and elegantly
formed ear.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where shall I be, godfather?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>“Never mind where! They have not bored your ears,
Nettie!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No; I haven’t had my ears bored, but I saw a picture
of an Indian with his nose bored.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Pooh—yet, after all, one is about as barbarous as the
other, little Nettie. Nettie, my little girl, would you like
to go home and live with me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Go home and live ’long o’ you! Um-m-m-me—no!
I had rather you’d come and live ’long o’ me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“’Cause I don’t want to leave granny; she wouldn’t
have anybody to hug her up and keep her back warm at
night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But if we were to take granny with us, too?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Um-m—me. Could you take Hugh along, too?”
asked the child, with the astute air of one making a
shrewd bargain.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” very decidedly answered General Garnet; adding,
in a lower tone, “No more childish friendships
ripening into mature love.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Very well, then, godfather, if you love me, you’ll
have to come and live ’long of us; for I can’t go home
’long o’ you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why not, pray?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“’Cause, godfather, how could Hugh live here by himself?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, little ‘Martha,’ anxious and troubled about
many things, Hugh need not live here by himself. Suppose
I was to get a situation for Hugh?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A what?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Suppose I were to put Hugh in the way of getting an
honest living?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“La, godfather, no white men about here except niggers
ever get an honest living, and I can’t let you black
Hugh’s face and crisp his hair—that’s black enough already—and
make a nigger of him!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You silly child, you will let me make a lawyer, or a
doctor, or a parson of him, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Before Nettie could answer Hugh Hutton came up,
cap in hand, and stood facing General Garnet.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>“Well, my boy?” said the latter.</p>

<p class='c010'>“General Garnet, if you have any notion of taking
Nettie away from here, just look out for her and the old
lady, who has had the care of her so long, and never mind
me. I can take care of myself. Nettie, darlin’, never
stop for me; I know what to do with myself. And now,
general, as long as I am talking to you, I must tell you
I don’t believe one word about Dr. Hardcastle’s being
a worthless man, because I know he is a good and great
man; nor do I believe one word of Miss Elsie’s breaking
her mother’s heart, because—because I know she is as
good as she is beautiful. You needn’t be angry. I
should have hated myself if I hadn’t spoke out!” exclaimed
the boy, his frank, brave spirit flashing boldly
from his eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the words had scarcely left the lips of Hugh before
Nettie had jumped to her feet, and administered a
sound box on the ear to him, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now! take that! Now, you make godfather out to
be a story-teller again!” And having given her sharp
little lesson, Nettie sprung back to her seat, and threw
her arms again around his neck. General Garnet, without
seeming to have seen her action, regarded the boy
with a sort of gentle, dignified surprise and leisurely
scorn, merely saying:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, you impertinent young dog!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Nettie sprang down a second time. General Garnet
gently attempted to restrain her, but she dashed his
hands away, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let me alone, godfather. You are wicked and ugly,
and I hate you. He’s not an impudent young dog at all!
he is my dear, gentle brother Hugh,” she said, throwing
herself about the neck of the boy, who folded his arms
around her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You must please to excuse Nettie, sir; indeed she is
the wildest, queerest child that ever was born. But then,
you know, she was wild and queer before ever I took her
in hand,” said Miss Joe, who was all this time busy with
a saucepan over the fire; and a pitcher, a bowl, and some
eggs, sugar, and spices on a chair by her side.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>“Nettie seems to have very little self-control or any
other sort of control,” dryly observed the general.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now if you aint mad long o’ granny. Just as if it
was her fault. And she making you mulled cider, too,
to keep the cold out of your stomach. And taking the
top-knot hen’s eggs, too, that she was saving to set, because
they’re a first-rate breed of hens, that lay eggs all
the winter, and she wants more of them. And she had
but six eggs, and now she’s taken three to make you
mulled cider to keep the cold from striking to your stomach;
and you to get mad long o’ her, and cut her up
short for nothing. Never mind him, granny. I’ll speak
right up for you, and take your part,” said Nettie, with
her arms still clasped around Hugh’s neck, looking at her
guardian, who was regarding her with a smile of mingled
amusement and condescending toleration.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t you mind her, sir. Eggs aint no scarcity in
this house; no, nor anything else you could want. Would
you like the leg of a cold turkey, broiled, with a little
currant jelly, sir? Or a few queen-cakes, with a glass of
good old sherry?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, granny, I thought you hadn’t——” began
Nettie, but Hugh put his hand over her lip and whispered:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t talk too much, Nettie. Go make friends with
your guardian.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Nettie turned, saw once more the tolerant, indulgent
smile that was beaming upon her, and, with her usual
way of assimilating only the good and the beauty of a
mixed thing, sprang at once to his arms, to his neck,
and caressing him vehemently, asked:</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are not mad with me, are you, godfather? I
love you dearly! dearly! ’Deed I do, godfather!” And
turning around his bushy face between her little hands,
she kissed him many times, repeating her question:
“You are not mad ’long o’ me, are you, godfather?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, darling little Nettie, I am not.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I have often thought that the spell of power that child
held over that man’s hard, stern, reserved nature was
this: The blending of passionate fondness with perfect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>freedom, frankness, and fearlessness in her feelings and
her manners toward him.</p>

<p class='c010'>General Garnet then turned, and, addressing himself
seriously to the old lady, informed her that he thought
the time had come for him to discharge the great obligation
under which he lay to his worthy deceased friend,
the late gallant Corporal Seabright, and redeem the
promise made to his widow when dying by taking care
of the rearing, education, and future fortunes of their
orphan girl. That it was now expedient that his dear
little goddaughter and ward should be brought into
proper restraint and training; that, in order that this
should be fittingly accomplished, it was necessary that his
sweet little ward should become an inmate of his house,
and live under his immediate protection and supervision;
that, being most unhappily a widower, and having no
lady at the head of his establishment to look after his
household, and do the honors, he should be under the
necessity of engaging the services of some highly respectable
matron as housekeeper; that he thought no
more competent person for the duties of the position
could be found in the world than Miss Josephine Cotter,
and, under all the circumstances, no one could be found
to fill the situation with such perfect propriety; that if
she chose to exchange her lodge on the isle for the housekeeper’s
rooms at Mount Calm, she might name her own
salary, and he would come up to it or exceed it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Joe’s eyes twinkled under her iron-bound spectacles,
but she hesitated to answer.</p>

<p class='c010'>General Garnet gave her full time to digest his proposition,
while he toyed with the child upon his knee—telling
her of her new home and new prospects, as far as he
thought she could comprehend them; promising her new
dresses, books, playthings, a pony, etc. Finally, he raised
his head and turned to Miss Joe, saying:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, madam, have you reflected upon my proposition,
and what do you think of it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Joe hemmed, cleared her throat, blew her nose,
wiped the tears from her eyes, rubbed her specs and replaced
them, and then said:</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>She didn’t know. She was used to staying where she
was. She had lived there twenty odd years, and did not
feel like leaving it at her time of life. Besides, she must
see what could be done for Hugh. She must take time to
consider. She couldn’t give an answer no way till next
day.</p>

<p class='c010'>General Garnet acceded to the short delay, and, smiling
to himself, arose to take leave; tasted and praised Miss
Joe’s mulled cider; kissed and fondly embraced little
Nettie; nodded to Hugh Hutton; shook hands with Miss
Joe, and withdrew.</p>

      <div class='line in48'><i>—Howitt.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Very early on the morning of the 2d of January,
while yet the level rays of the newly-risen sun were projecting
golden lines of light aslant the snow-covered
earth, the traveling carriage of General Garnet passed
through Huttontown on its way to the beach to take in
Miss Joe and little Nettie, who were that day to leave
their island home.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the same hour Miss Joe was bustling over her last
preparations at the isle. The simple furniture was to be
safely stowed away and left in the house; the most valuable
portion of their personal effects was to be transported
to Mount Calm at more leisure; her own and
Nettie’s clothing was packed into a chest ready to be
taken away.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hugh’s bundle was made up and slung at the end of a
stick across his shoulder. The boy certainly looked the
most hopeful and happy of the three.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dear Hugh, you do just ’mind me of Jack in the fairy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>tale, going to seek his fortune,” said Nettie, gazing at
him with admiration.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nettie herself was wild with joy and expectation.
Scarcely had she slept or ate since the noted visit of her
godfather. How could she? All the fairy tales she had
ever read in her life were about to be realized in her own
person; she was Cinderella, going in splendid style to
the royal palace, to be married to the king’s son; she
was Beauty, who had just discovered the Beast to be a
handsome, powerful prince, who was going to make a
princess of her; or, if not literally so, her dreams were
equally fanciful and extravagant. But how different was
the reality, poor Nettie! more fairy-favored as wood-sprite
in the forest wild, or water-nymph in her sea-girt
isle than ever as heiress of the millionaire in the cold
magnificence of Mount Calm.</p>

<p class='c010'>The last thing Miss Joe did was to put out the fire and
dress Nettie in a little cloak of scarlet country cloth,
made with a hood to go over her head.</p>

<p class='c010'>At which Nettie, with many extravagant capers, declared
herself to be Little Red Riding Hood in person.</p>

<p class='c010'>When all was done and the house locked up, the three
took their way down the solitary footpath through the
snow to the water’s edge.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hugh had already cleaned out the boat, and they all
got into it. Hugh took the oar. The water was very
smooth, the current in their favor, and in twenty minutes
the boy landed his charge safely upon the beach.</p>

<p class='c010'>The carriage of General Garnet was in waiting.</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Joe and Nettie were handed in by Hugh, and then
the boy put in his hand to bid them a sorrowful
good-by.</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Joe burst into tears, sobbed aloud, told Hugh if
he should not find his place as shop-boy at Mr. Fig’s
grocery pleasant to let her know and she would go right
back to Hutton’s Isle, and they two would work together
and see better times when the warm weather
should come.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nettie, for her part, much as she loved Hugh, could
not cry. She had read too many fairy tales not to know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>how her own ought to end; and so Nettie felt perfectly
assured that by some dénouement at Mount Calm every
wish of her heart must be accomplished, most especially
the dearest wish of all, that of having her playmate always
with her. So they took leave. Hugh struck into a
by-path, and walked off briskly toward the store of Mr.
Fig. And the carriage rolled on up through the main
street of the village and out over the country road that
led over the snow-covered hills and through the hollow
to Mount Calm.</p>

<p class='c010'>Arrived at Mount Calm they were met by General
Garnet, who, receiving little Nettie in his arms, pressed
her fondly and carried her into the house, followed by
Miss Joe. Here, in the hall, he delivered the little girl
to the charge of a neatly-dressed “ladylike” mulatto girl
with a gray Madras turban on her head and a pair of
heavy gold hoops in her ears, telling her to take Miss
Seabright to the chamber lately occupied by Miss Garnet,
and to prepare her for the breakfast table.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And what’s your name?” asked Nettie, looking up
with curiosity at the gay mulatto.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nettie, my darling, she is Hero, your maid,” said
General Garnet.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hero took the hand of the child and was about to
lead her up the great staircase, when Nettie suddenly
broke from her, and, exclaiming, interrogatively: “This
way?” sprang up the stairs like a squirrel.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hero tripped after her, overtook her on the landing,
and gently took her hand, saying:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Miss Seabright, young ladies oughtn’t to romp
through a quiet house, and race upstairs in that manner.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know young ladies oughtn’t to, but I am a little
gal.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are a little lady, and should act like one. But
here is your chamber, Miss Seabright,” said Hero, opening
the door of Elsie’s beautiful room.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, how—how grand!” exclaimed Nettie, breaking
from her maid, springing into the midst of the apartment,
and standing gazing, speechless with admiration upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>the splendor—for such they were to her—of the furniture.</p>

<p class='c010'>The French paper on the walls, with its pretty pattern
of wild rose vines climbing up gilded pillars and forming
into arches: the carpet on the floor, chosen to match,
with wild rose vines running over a white ground; the
pink damask and white muslin curtains of the windows,
that suffused the whole chamber with a soft, roseate
light; the rosewood dressing bureau standing between
these two windows, with its tall mirror and marble top,
and elegant ornaments of porcelain, pearl and gold; the
rosewood bedstead, standing in the opposite recess, with
its white-embossed counterpane, and rich valance, all
softly shaded by hanging curtains of pink damask, like
those of the windows; the wardrobe, with its mirror
doors, occupying the side to the left of the chimney; the
marble-top table, with its elegant trifles—a work-box of
mother-of-pearl and gold, a standish of ebony, inlaid with
ivory, a portfolio, books, etc.; the work-stand of satinwood;
the luxurious sofa, chair, and ottoman, covered
with rose-colored cut velvet to suit the draperies; the polished
steel grate; with its silver mounting, and marble
mantelpiece, with its ormolu clock, vases, statuettes, medallions,
etc.; lastly, the paintings, few, but admirable,
though attractive to Nettie chiefly upon account of the
massive and richly-gilded frames.</p>

<p class='c010'>Introducing Nettie into that elegant, luxurious chamber
was like letting a monkey loose in a fancy-shop.
For a moment she stood shading her eyes with her hand,
as she would have done in looking upon a dazzling
winter landscape, gazing transfixed with surprise; and
then she ran hither and thither, seized this and that, upset
an inkstand, seized a porcelain bottle by its stopper,
letting the other part fall and break; knocked down an
elegant dressing-case, splitting off its pearl corners, and
spilling all its contents; jumping up into one of the
beautiful chairs and standing on it; snatched a statuette
of Thalia from the mantelpiece, and, calling it a doll-baby,
declared she would make it a red petticoat and give
it the name of Dolly.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>All this was the work of a minute, for then Hero went
and took her hand again, and said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come, Miss Seabright, all these pretty things are
yours, but you must learn to handle them carefully, so
as not to break and destroy them. Come, now, I have
to get you ready for breakfast. You are to eat breakfast
with the general. Come, let me wash your face
and comb your hair.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, indeed, you aint a-goin’ to wash my face and
comb my hair. I’ve washed my own face and combed
my own hair ever since I can remember, and I aint
a-goin’ to let anybody else do it now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, then, you do it; and here is such a pretty blue
dress of princess cloth, all trimmed with black braid;
and here is a black silk apron and a nice lace tucker, and
silk mits, and a tortoise-shell long comb to keep your
curls back, and here is a pair of black morocco boots,
see!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, how beautiful!” exclaimed the child admiringly,
as she hastened with her ablutions.</p>

<p class='c010'>When Nettie was arrayed in her new dress she scarcely
permitted her maid to tie the last thing, or turn the last
long ringlet behind the comb, before she sprang from
under her hands and fled downstairs to “show godfather
and granny how she looked dressed like a lady.”</p>

<p class='c010'>As Nettie sprang into the presence of her guardian he
arose and walked toward her, took her hand gently, and
told her that little girls must walk and not jump and
skip through the rooms of a house. Then he led her
into the breakfast room, where Miss Joe was already installed
at the head of the table, attended by a “genteel”
waiter. General Garnet seated his ward and took his
own place. Hero now made her appearance and stood
by her little mistress. But Nettie’s eyes were wandering
from the elegancies of the breakfast table, with its damask
tablecloth, fine napkins, Sevres china service, etc.,
to the superb sideboard, with its splendid array of cut-glass
and silver plate; and from the rich Turkey carpet
to the wonderful paper hangings of the walls that showed
the city of Paris by morning light. And Nettie’s maid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>had several times to remind her that little ladies did not
stare about, but ate their breakfast prettily, before she
could withdraw her attention from the new glories
around her and fix it upon her breakfast.</p>

<p class='c010'>But before the meal was half over Nettie had sprung
up and bounded out of the room in search of more novelties.
The hall, the library and the picture-gallery, the
parlor and the drawing room, the saloon and the conservatory—all
on the first floor—were in turn invaded
and overhauled by the eager, impetuous child. Then all
the chambers on the second floor were visited and ransacked.
And then the indefatigable little explorer made
for the attic, and besieged the doors of the locked-up
rooms there. Through all these runnings and ramblings
Hero followed her, telling her that little ladies should not
do this, or that, or the other.</p>

<p class='c010'>When night came, a little tired with her incessant running,
and a little fretted and dispirited with the ceaseless
accompaniment of her maid’s tuitions and fault-finding,
Nettie went into the library, where her guardian sat
luxuriating in his easy-chair at a table covered with
books and papers before a fine fire.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nettie was too tired to notice the elegant and luxurious
appointments of General Garnet’s favorite retreat; the
superb book-cases at intervals along the walls; the rare
and costly statues, busts, and oil-paintings; the tables
laden with prints and articles of virtu; the easy-chairs,
sofas, and foot-cushions; the deep, soft carpet, “stealing
all noises from the feet”; the heavy damask curtains,
excluding all cold air, and the splendid chandeliers
pendant from the ceiling and diffusing through their
stained glass shades a rich, warm, and glowing light
throughout the apartment. Nettie sauntered straight up
to General Garnet, climbed upon his knees, and threw
her head and arms languidly upon his bosom.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tired, my little Nettie?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, very tired, godfather, indeed. Take me in your
arms and rock me back and forward, as Hugh does.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You must forget Hugh and the isle, and the lodge,
and all your infantile life, little Nettie. You are going
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>to be a young lady, and some day you may feel mortified
if anyone reminded you of these things.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I think it would be wicked to forget them, godfather,
and indeed I won’t forget them, either,” said
Nettie, lifting herself from her resting-place.</p>

<p class='c010'>General Garnet saw his error. If he wished Nettie to
forget her past life, companions, and occupations, he must
never remind her of them. If she spoke of them, he
must not keep her mind fixed upon the subject even by
opposing it. He must draw her attention to something
else. Reaching out his hand, drawing a book of colored
prints up before him, and opening it, he said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have a great deal of curiosity, little Nettie. Here
are views taken on the Mediterranean; pictures of
strange places and old cities, which I will tell you about.
But as I do not wish to talk to a listless hearer, you must
first tell me when you see a picture that interests you,
and question me about anything that excites your curiosity,
and then I shall know that I am speaking to an attentive
pupil.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Nettie kissed her guardian rapturously, and, still sitting
on his knees, bent forward and eagerly turned over
the leaves of the folio, until a view on the coast of Greece
arrested her attention, and, pausing upon it, she caressed
her guardian and claimed the explanation. General
Garnet was absorbed in the description and history
of this plate, and Nettie was listening eagerly, when the
front door-bell was heard to ring. General Garnet
ceased talking, and raised his head and listened. Nettie
pressed her lips to his and listened, too. The library
door opened; a servant entered, and announced:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dr. Hardcastle!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Show Dr. Hardcastle in,” said General Garnet, gathering
Nettie closely to his bosom with one arm, resting
the other hand upon the table, and elevating his head
and Roman nose to the loftiest angle of scorn. A minute
passed, and then the door opened again, and Magnus
Hardcastle, still clothed in his rough emigrant suit, entered
the library, walked down its length, and stood face
to face with General Garnet.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus they stood:</p>

<p class='c010'>General Garnet had arisen and put Nettie from his
bosom, but she stood upon the chair he had just vacated,
with her arms around his neck, gazing at the newcomer.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dr. Hardcastle stood, cap in hand, immediately before
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>They looked at each other. The countenance of General
Garnet was calm and impassable; he could afford to
be calm; he had his revenge in his hand—in his arms!
The countenance of Magnus was frank, open, eager as
ever, yet tempered with a certain gravity and earnestness
of expression.</p>

<p class='c010'>But a single instant they thus regarded each other, and
then:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, sir?” said General Garnet.</p>

<p class='c010'>Magnus held forth his hand, saying seriously:</p>

<p class='c010'>“General Garnet, I have come a day’s journey back
from my Western road to offer you my hand in amity,
to say to you how kindly I feel, and must ever feel, toward
the father of my beloved wife—to say how much
I desire your friendship—how much we all desire a
reconciliation. Will you take my hand?” General Garnet
drew himself up and remained silent. Nettie, with
her arms still around his neck, gazed with interest at
their visitor. Magnus dropped his hand, but continued:
“Sir, I can understand the resentment of disappointed
ambition. But I do not, and will not, believe such anger
to be implacable; not now—not under the afflicting dispensation
of your recent deplorable bereavement. General
Garnet, I had proceeded a day and night upon my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>westward journey before I received a letter from Mr.
Wilson announcing the sudden death of Mrs. Garnet.
My dear wife was overwhelmed with sorrow, a sorrow
which I also deeply felt. She reproached herself bitterly
with a thousand fancied sins against her lost mother,
vowing in her remorse and despair what she would give,
or do, could the grave but give up its dead. ‘The grave
is inexorable!’ General Garnet, to some extent I have
judged your heart by hers. The husband and the daughter
have a common sorrow. The husband must have
suffered as much as the daughter. General Garnet, can
I venture to speak candidly to you? Can I venture to
say that, little as your Alice may have been loved or valued
while she was still by your side, in your daily path,
yet now that she has vanished from your sight you miss
her in a thousand endearing attentions—in a thousand
gentle ministrations every moment of your life. You
miss her in countless comforts, and nameless refinements
of comfort, of which she, till lost, was the quiet, unsuspecting
origin. And now you find out the cause by missing
the effect!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘How blessings brighten as they take their flight!’”
said General Garnet, in a low, ironical tone, filling up the
pause made by Magnus. But, without observing the
sneer, Dr. Hardcastle replied, gravely and sweetly:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes! ‘We know not that an angel had been with us
till we saw the glory of her vanishing wing!’ In your
deep heart, was it not thus with you, General Garnet? Is
it not so in a modified way with many of us? Oh, the
loved and lost! we may have misapprehended, undervalued,
misused them in life; but let the inexorable hand
of Death be laid upon them, and how changed are all our
feelings toward them! How remorsefully we appreciate
their worth; how despairingly we love them. What
would we not sacrifice to restore motion, warmth, consciousness
to that still, cold heart, so we might press it
beating to our bosom; to restore light to those folded
eyes, so we might gaze into them all the remorse, all the
love we feel, but cannot speak; to restore life to the dead,
that we might see them again at our fireside or table is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>the old, familiar dress, with the old, familiar look; that
we might be a saint or a slave to them thenceforth for
ever! Take a closer case; take that of your Alice. Could
now the doors of that vault where you laid her fly open
and yield up its beautiful dead—or, to leave the supernatural
and impossible out of the question, could Alice
be found to have been laid there during a fit of epilepsy,
as has sometimes been the case with others, and could
she now be restored to you living, loving, would you
not rejoice as you never rejoiced before—would you not
love and value her as you never loved or valued her before—would
you not do anything on earth to render her
renewed life happy?” Magnus paused again to see the
effect of this hint of the truth, thinking, also, that in the
event of General Garnet remaining obdurate, he had possibly
verged too nearly upon a disclosure.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the stern, immovable countenance of the latter betrayed
no emotion, either of suspicion or of relenting.
It positively gave no clew to his thoughts or feelings.
Magnus hoped the best, yet withdrew from the precipice
of a dangerous confidence by saying:</p>

<p class='c010'>“But to leave improbable things also. Could you
wake up in the morning and find that you had only
dreamed her death, and see her by your side—living,
beautiful, loving—would you not clasp her to your heart
in joy, exclaiming: ‘Oh, dearest wife, I have had such
a dreadful dream! It seemed, too, so very real. I
dreamed that you were dead, Alice. Thank God, it was
nothing but a dream! Now, ask me what you will,
Alice, for I am so happy to know I have you yet—to
know that you have not gone from my side, but are
here—here!—that I can refuse you nothing.’ Would
those not be your words and feelings? And what would
Alice say—what would Alice ask? What was nearest her
heart when she fell asleep? What would she say could
she now be restored, and should you ask her what would
make her happy, but ‘Father, be reconciled to your
daughter!’ General Garnet, the same letter that announced
our sudden and mutual bereavement, the letter
of that Christian minister, expressed a hope that the hand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>of Death, which had led our friend away from our midst,
leaving us all in a common sorrow, might reunite our
hands in amity. General Garnet, that hope is my prayer.
I entreat you, take my hand!”</p>

<p class='c010'>General Garnet recoiled a step, and answered scornfully:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sir, I know you for an orator of old. But if you hope
to work upon my feelings through the sorrow of my recent
and very sudden loss, you deceive yourself. And
now, hear me! Could—as you have put the question—could
the doors of my wife’s tomb fly open—and could
she be restored to me, living, loving, in all the beauty
and goodness of her being—could such impossibilities
occur—and should the first boon she craved to bless her
renewed life be the reconciliation you desire, that boon
would be refused, though that refusal should send her
back into the grave! Now I hope you understand me
thoroughly.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Dr. Hardcastle nodded his head several times, keeping
time to his thoughts, as he said, in his heart:</p>

<p class='c010'>“And little do you surmise, poor man, that your refusal
will send her back to the grave—for you! That she will
be indeed dead—to you!”</p>

<p class='c010'>General Garnet, taking this nod for one of assent,
added:</p>

<p class='c010'>“And now, I hope, sir, that no more false hopes may
be raised upon me. Neither you nor your wife need ever
expect anything at my hands. By my fireside, and at my
board, and in my heart, the place of the late Miss Garnet
is filled. This little girl, sir, is my daughter and heiress.
I have regularly and legally adopted her. The late Miss
Garnet had, but for your reminder, passed from my memory.
Mrs. Hardcastle is an alien and a stranger, and I
desire that she remain such. I beg you also to remember,
sir, that, though I have a slight electioneering acquaintance
with Dr. Hardcastle, such as every prominent
politician may have with persons not to be recognized
under any other circumstances, I do not wish even that
acquaintance to continue. And I beg you to recollect
that I have never even seen Mrs. Hardcastle, and never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>wish to see her. I do not know the person, and never
wish to know her. Have you anything more to advance,
Dr. Hardcastle?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir!” said Magnus, drawing himself up, and as
his fine chest expanded, looking at his adversary with a
brow, a glance that made him quail and drop his eyes.
“You have dared to misrepresent my purpose in coming
to you, or else you have naturally mistaken my motives—naturally,
for it may not be in your nature to understand
them. Yet, no, it is not so. You do not mistake
me. And do not dare to affect it again. You know that
your fortune is nothing—absolutely nothing—to me, and
never was. So little do rank and fortune weigh with me
against hearts and souls that, had I been a millionaire
and had Elsie been the child of a beggar instead of a
daughter of General Garnet, and the heiress of Mount
Calm, I would have taken her to my bosom in the face
of all the world. And, more—further, had Elsie possessed,
in her own inalienable right, hundreds of millions,
and I possessed no more than the clothes I wore,
I would have married her, and not thanked her for the
millions she brought me, but simply loved her for the
beauty, the goodness, the love, the dear womanhood she
gave me. So little do I value money where nature and
affection are concerned. As it is, we are both poor, both
will have to work hard. Elsie has chosen her lot in life,
and shall abide by it. Even you, her father, shall not
rescue her from it with your wealth. You cannot change
her destiny. Your fortune could not do it. I am resolved
to make, to command whatever success may be in life
for us. Yet”—he added, with a softening brow and tone—“yet,
father of my dear wife—for her sake, for your
own, for mine, I would be reconciled with you. Spite
of all the bitter things written upon your forehead, and
spoken by your lips, and which I do not think your
heart indorses, I would be at peace with you; bitter talk
is but hasty breath. Let us forget it. Let us be friends.
Now, then, for the last time I offer you my hand. For
the last time, I beseech you take it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>General Garnet frowned darkly and averted his head.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>But Nettie, who had been gazing kindly and admiringly
at the speaker, now suddenly thrust out her little
hand, and, emphatically striking it into the broad, open
palm of Magnus, exclaimed cordially:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes! Let us be friends! I’ll be friends! I like
you!”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was no resisting that sparkling, cordial smile—that
earnest, confiding manner, and Magnus closed his
hand upon the child’s hand, pressing it kindly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Godfather, why don’t you ask the good-looking gentleman
to sit down, and why don’t you ring the bell and
have wine brought for him like you did for Mr. Judge
Jacky? Sit down, gentleman, in that armchair, and I
will go and ring the bell,” she said, jumping down and
running to the bell-rope, which she pulled vigorously.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will you be seated, sir?” said General Garnet
ironically.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will you first take my hand, General Garnet?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, sir! To forbear is the utmost limit of my self-control.
I cannot go further, and forgive. Yet you are
in my house—standing by my fireside. While you bestow
upon us your presence, I beg you be seated.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Magnus waved his hand in rejection of this invitation
and turned to go, but Nettie, returning from her vociferous
bell-ringing, stopped him by seizing both his hands
and leaning up against him as she exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c010'>“No! you mustn’t go till you get something—I hear a
boy coming now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And at this moment, indeed, the door was opened, and
a waiter appeared in answer to the noisy summons.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Get some good wine and some sort o’ witches—you
make with bread and butter and ham—sandwitches, and
bring up here for this gentleman. And make haste, you
hear, because he is in a hurry,” said Nettie to the waiter.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man looked with surprise and perplexity from the
self-constituted little mistress to the master. And General
Garnet, in some perversity of mood, exclaimed
fiercely:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, sir! Why do you pause? Did you hear Miss
Seabright’s order?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>“Yes, sir, but——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Go and obey it, then. Do you wait for me to tell
you that her commands here are only second to my
own?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, why don’t you go along when I tell you that the
good-looking gentleman is in a great hurry? What
makes you look so queer?” exclaimed Nettie, stamping
with impatience, but not with ill-humor.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man bowed and withdrew.</p>

<p class='c010'>Again Dr. Hardcastle sought to free himself from his
loving little captor, but Nettie clung to him like a very
nettle, or an opossum to a tree, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, sir, you mustn’t go; you shan’t go, till the wine
comes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And before he could get away the wine and sandwiches
arrived. As the waiter walked straight up the
room and set the refreshments upon the table, General
Garnet turned coldly to Dr. Hardcastle, saying:</p>

<p class='c010'>“My little daughter invites you to take something.
Will you do so, sir?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Dr. Hardcastle, who had been released by Nettie, declined
the invitation, and retired, followed into the hall
by Nettie, who sought to recapture and detain him. He
raised the child, kissed her, and left the house at
once.</p>

<p class='c010'>After he had gone Nettie remained standing in the hall
so long that General Garnet came out to seek her. Having
found her, he exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why do you linger so, my little Nettie? Come with
me into the library, and let us go on with the pictures
and stories.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t want to go back to the library with you, godfather.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What! Don’t want to return with me and see the
beautiful pictures, and hear the wonderful stories?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No; I don’t care for the pictures, nor the stories, nor
you, either, godfather. I want to go to my own room—and
I wish you would call my maid.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Whe-ew! How my little princess takes state upon
herself! But I must say it becomes her—rarely. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>why does she not care for pictures, stories, or godfather,
either?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Because, godfather, you treated the pleasant-spoken
gentleman so meanly. I’m sure when I and Hugh and
granny lived in the poor lodge, and had nothing to offer
but persimmon beer and sour, knobby apples, we never
treated our visitors so meanly. No, that we didn’t!
Granny used to say, ‘Hospit—something or other—before
everything’ which meant that it was a shame to treat
well-behaved company meanly. And you treated the
pleasant-spoken gentleman meanly. ’Deed, I thought he
preached nice as the parson. But you treated him
meanly—and I don’t want to have anything to do with
you, and I won’t, either, have anything to do with you,
godfather. I want my maid. Will you please to send
her to me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Piqued, amused, attracted by the naïve candor and
courage of the fond but passionate child, General Garnet
laughed and held out his arms, saying:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, come to me, my little Nettie. Come and kiss me,
and give me one of your tight hugs.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“’Deed, I won’t, godfather!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Won’t! Why?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“’Cause I don’t feel like it, one bit.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t feel like it! Well, then, now what shall I give
my little Nettie for a good, hearty hug and kiss—say?
Shall it be a pony, or a little carriage, or a great wax
doll, or what? Come! say now. What shall it be?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nothing, godfather. You will give me all them
things, anyhow, ’cause you promised them to me if I’d
come and live ’long o’ you. But I aint sure that I will
take any of them—and I aint even sure that I shall stay.”</p>

<p class='c010'>General Garnet laughed aloud, and said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Very well! if you won’t come and give me a good,
hearty hug and kiss, neither for free love nor bribery, I
can come and give you one.” And he went toward her.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nettie ran, flew up the stairs, and from the first landing
looked down to see if she was pursued, and said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, you mustn’t, indeed, godfather. I had rather
anyone hit me a hard lick right in the face than kiss me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>when I don’t want to be kissed. And I don’t want to
be kissed by you, godfather. I wouldn’t kiss you hardly
to save your life.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And having said this, Nettie fled the rest of the way
upstairs. Hero was already there with a light to take
charge of her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Strange! How strange it is that I love that wild
child more and more—need her love more and more
every hour that I live! Strange, passing strange, that
with all her willfulness, I love that half-savage, but most
beautiful thing, better than I ever loved anyone in the
wide world! Oh, it is not strange, after all! It is because
she loves me thoroughly—with every fiber of her soul
and body; because I can trust in her, for she hides nothing
from me—not even her childish anger.”</p>

<hr class='c011'>

<p class='c010'>Dr. Hardcastle returned to Huttontown, and to the
tavern, where he was to lodge that night. He intended
to retire early, preparatory to a very early start the next
morning. But first it was necessary to go to Mr. Fig’s
for the purpose of making a few purchases of articles
that had been forgotten in his first packing up.</p>

<p class='c010'>When he entered the grocery he saw, to his surprise,
Hugh Hutton behind the counter, ready to serve him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, my boy,” said he, extending his hand, “I am
surprised and happy to see you again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, doctor! have you really turned back? I am so
very glad!” exclaimed Hugh, his countenance actually
illuminated with joy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, my boy. We had proceeded but a day’s journey,
when we heard of Mrs. Garnet’s death, and came
back.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where is Mrs. Hardcastle? Is she at the inn?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, my boy; finding that we came too late for the
funeral I took Mrs. Hardcastle immediately back to Deep
Dell, where she now sojourns, waiting for me. I found
it necessary to come back a second time. I have traveled
the road between Huttontown and Deep Dell forth
and back twice within a week, Hugh; and to-morrow
morning, at five o’clock, I make the third start.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>“The old folks say that there is great luck in the third
attempt,” said Hugh.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should think there was in my instance, if I could
take you back with me, my boy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, sir, Dr. Hardcastle, you can if you will,” exclaimed
Hugh, in a tone of anxious, eager solicitude.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I assuredly will, if I can. And no obstacle exists with
me. But your little sister, my boy?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, sir, my little sister is better provided for than I
could hope to provide for her for many years to come.
She is the ward of General Garnet, and he has just this
morning taken her home to live with him, and to be
educated.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How? What? Is it possible? The little, fond, wild,
beautiful creature I saw at Mount Calm to-night?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir, that was she—Garnet Seabright.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What kin is she to you, boy—not your sister?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No kin at all, sir; but dear to me as if she were my
twin sister.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A beautiful child! A sweet, wild, haunting thing!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, yes, sir; and so true and good—so trusting!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A little eerie, spirit-like thing! What a pity!” said
Dr. Hardcastle, communing with himself; then, raising
his voice, he said: “Well, you desire to accompany me,
my boy? But how long have you been with Mr. Fig,
and what are your obligations to him?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No obligations at all, sir. The truth is, seeing that
from having been a help to aunty and Nettie in the time
of their need I had got to be a hindrance in the way of
their doing better than I could do for them, I went to
Mr. Fig and told him that I would stand behind the
counter and help about the store, for no more than my
mere board—not even asking clothing—on conditions,
it should be understood, I was to go to the West the
very first chance that came. Well, Mr. Fig knew me, and
how much I could do, and agreed to my plan; and so I
came this morning, and have done a very hard day’s
work, too—hauling several cartloads of freight from the
brig up to the store, and unloading them, and storing
them in, and waiting behind the counter the rest of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>time. All that makes me feel well to-night. So, you
see, sir, I owe Mr. Fig nothing but good friendship; and
I am ready to set out with you to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Be it so, then, my boy. And I am rejoiced to know
that in thus following the bent of your inclinations, you
abandon no duty. Will you join me to-night, or early
to-morrow morning?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Early to-morrow morning, Dr. Hardcastle. You
may pick me up at the south gate of the falling-field, behind
Mount Calm—that will be directly in your road. I
must go up to Mount Calm, to-night, to bid good-by to
Aunt Joe and Nettie.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Very well, my boy. Be punctual.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And having obtained the articles for which he came
Dr. Hardcastle left the store.</p>

<p class='c010'>That night Hugh Hutton went up to Mount Calm.
He succeeded in obtaining entrance to his Aunt Joe’s
rooms, but found, to his regret, that Nettie had some
time before retired to bed, and was now fast asleep. He
spent the night on a pallet in his aunt’s room, and in the
morning made up his bundle to start. Miss Joe objected,
cried, bemoaned her fate and Hugh’s, but finally
consented to his departure; for Miss Joe believed in
Hugh and had faith in Dr. Hardcastle, besides it would
not sound so badly to tell the neighbors, by and by,
that her nephew, Hugh Hutton, was “studying medicine
underneath Dr. Hardcastle.” So Miss Joe gave him
her blessing, and went to wake up Nettie, to bid him
farewell, prophesying all the while that Nettie would
“take on dreadful.” But Nettie did not “take on” at
all; she threw herself joyously around Hugh’s neck,
gave him a hearty hug and kiss, and declared, that with
his bundle across his shoulder he was Jack the Giant-Killer,
going to seek his fortune; and that he must let
her know about every giant he killed, and every enchanted
lady he freed, and every magician’s castle he
took, and ever beautiful princess that loved him. And
then she pulled the scarlet worsted comforter from her
neck and wound it around Hugh’s throat, tucking the
ends into his coat breast, and bid him good-by. Hugh
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>went to the door, turned to take a last look, impulsively
darted back, clasped his old aunty, and then Nettie, in a
last embrace, sprung from the room, and was gone. A
rapid walk brought him to the spot where he found Dr.
Hardcastle, just arrived in his carryall, waiting for him,
and exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Just in time, my boy—and very welcome. Jump in!
All right!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The place selected by Magnus Hardcastle as the field
of his life labor was that grandly picturesque portion of
Maryland now known as Alleghany County, but then
called indifferently the Mountains, the Wilderness, or the
Backwoods. The site chosen for his home was a wildly
beautiful spot in the midst of a deep, narrow valley lying
between two ridges of the Alleghany Mountains, and
watered by a branch of the Potomac River. Although
Magnus Hardcastle’s first idea of a home in the backwoods
presented nothing but a log cabin, and although
his young and lovely bride was quite ready to dare and
share the unmitigated rudeness and privations of such
a home and life, yet Providence, who “tempereth the
wind to the shorn lamb,” mercifully ameliorated the
hardships of the condition for the delicately nurtured
girl, who, however willing, was, notwithstanding all her
health and strength, scarcely able to bear the shock of
such a sharp and sudden change. The contents of that
casket—the bridal gift of Alice Garnet to her daughter—amounted
to nearly five thousand dollars, and though
the whole of this sum would go but a very little way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>toward supplying the superfluities of a fashionable
bride’s trousseau, yet the half of it went very far toward
completing and furnishing a comfortable backwoods
home for our young couple. Their house was a log
cabin indeed, but one of “ample size” and commodious
appointments.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was near the close of a fine winter day that Alice
and Elsie were together in the family rooms of the cabin.
This apartment was large, and supplied with all needful
furniture. The walls were lathed and plastered, but not
whitewashed, and retaining the original stone color, gave
a sober tone to the air of the room. There was no
carpet on the floor, but the broad hearth was a notable
specimen of the fine arts, by Hugh Hutton, who declared,
in his pride, that it was an interesting, instructive, and
endless study, to anyone fond of tracing the individuality
and infinite variety of natural form and color. The
hearth was, in fact, a fine mosaic of fragments of rocks,
of divers forms, sizes, and colors, perfectly filled in, leveled
and chinked with a hard, white composition, that
formed an irregular boundary line between the pieces.
Each side the ample fireplace were dressers, constructed
of strong plank, and at once laden and ornamented with
crockery ware. From the lowest and broadest shelves
hung dark calico curtains, reaching to the floor, and
concealing “the humble little household gods,” as Elsie
called them. There were chairs and tables, made more
for strength than beauty, ranged along the walls. The
windows were curtained with dark calico. There was no
article of luxury, no superfluity in the room, but everything
was convenient, orderly, and immaculately clean.</p>

<p class='c010'>A fine fire blazed in the broad chimney, and though
the hour was growing dark, it illuminated the room, so
as to render a lighted candle unnecessary. The tea-kettle
hung over the blaze, an oven lid sat upon the logs
by its side, and the oven was turned up against the front
of the fire to heat for baking.</p>

<p class='c010'>Elsie stood at a deal-table, making out biscuits—busy,
healthful, and happy as ever.</p>

<p class='c010'>A little to the left of the blazing, too-hot fire, sat Alice,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>in a rocking-chair, and—a reverie. There was but one
change in Alice since we saw her last. The sunny ringlets
of her unfaded hair (be it remembered that she was
but thirty-five), the sunny ringlets of her hair were
turned around her cheek, and their end twisted around
with her back braid. A little lace cap which she wore,
because she said a cap was proper for her at her time of
life, and in her relations, sat gracefully upon her still
beautiful head, and gave a softness to the outline of her
delicate and spiritual face, making her seem even more
youthful and beautiful than before. She had been embroidering
an infant’s dress, but the work had dropped
into her lap, and her hand had fallen upon the little
snow-white heap of muslin, and the richly-chased gold
thimble glittered idly in the firelight; but the tiny foot,
in the delicate slipper, was not idle—it turned upon the
rockers of a cradle, where, amid downy pillows and soft
white drapery, reposed a lovely babe of about two months
of age. Altogether this beautiful and graceful group was
a little out of keeping with the log cabin, to which it
nevertheless lent a charm. But then, Elsie had always
laughingly said that her mother was an ingrain “lady,”
while she herself, for her own part, was “only a woman.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Elsie having finished making out her biscuits, brought
the tray to the fire to put them on to bake. While kneeling
with one knee upon the hearth to arrange her bread
in the oven, she looked up at her mother’s pensive face,
and said, sympathetically:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dear mother, it seems to me you are not happy,
though you would have us believe it is so?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Elsie, no one is perfectly happy; that is a saying as
old as the plucking of the forbidden fruit that first
brought suffering into the world, and yet we never believe
it. We are ever striving for that perfect happiness
which is impossible.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not believe it to be impossible, dear mother. I
am a firm believer in perfect earthly happiness; I am so
near it myself. Why, even now, I should be perfectly
happy but for the shadow on your brow, mother.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘But,’ there is ever a ‘but.’ It is the order of life,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>and I am content with it. Be at ease, dear; I, too, should
be perfectly happy, but——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What, dearest mother?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am a living falsehood, Elsie.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mother!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Child, I did not mean to speak so strongly. But I
have a secret to keep that pains me always—a sinful
secret, inasmuch as I am conscious that the keeping of
it may cause sin in others.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sin, mother?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, Elsie; your father is in the prime of life; he believes
himself a widower. What if he were to marry
again?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ha! I never thought of that. It seems so strange
to me that people should ever marry again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know it does, my happy Elsie; but, nevertheless,
they do, you know. Elsie, I have refrained from speaking
of my thought, because I did not wish to distress
you or have an argument with your husband; but, my
love, I feel that I ought to write to General Garnet, and
after that, as you and yours are doing so very well, and
as you are all so comfortable and happy, and as I should
not be missed among you, I think, if General Garnet
wishes it, I ought to go home.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He will not wish it, mother; you know he has a gentlemanly
horror of a nine days’ wonder. Sweet mother,
you must remain with us. Not miss you! Whom should
we have to wait upon and adore if you were gone? And
as for writing, mother, talk to Magnus about that. Here
he comes now, and Hugh with him, as usual, and—a
stranger with him, as unusual. Who can it be?” said
Elsie, as, setting the lid upon the oven and replacing the
tray upon the table, she looked out of the window into
the moonlit yard.</p>

<p class='c010'>The door opened, and Magnus Hardcastle entered, accompanied
by a gentleman, and followed by Hugh Hutton.
The stranger was clothed in a suit of rusty black,
his tall, slim figure was slightly bowed, and his black
hair was thickly mixed with gray.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come in, sir; come in, sir. Hugh, my student, there,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>will care for your horse. Come in, sir. It is needless
to say that you are most gladly welcome. A guest is a
God-send to us. Come to the fire, sir,” said Dr. Hardcastle,
leading the way.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mrs. Garnet, let me present to you the Rev. Mr. Sinclair,
missionary to the Winnebagoes, who will do us the
honor of resting in our cabin for a few days, on his
western route. Mr. Sinclair, Mrs. Garnet of Mount
Calm.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is it possible! Alice!” ejaculated the stranger, dropping
hat, gloves, and whip, and reeling on his feet.</p>

<p class='c010'>A slight paleness overspread the face of the lady, but
rising with perfect ease, she offered her hand, saying:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Sinclair, it is many years since we last met. I
am very glad to see you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He drew back, then took the hand she offered, and
looked wonderingly, searchingly, into her face, as if to
read her soul. Her face was impassible to him. Turning
to Dr. Hardcastle, she said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“My dear Magnus, this is a very old acquaintance
you have brought me, an acquaintance of my girlhood.
Elsie, my love!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Elsie came forward.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Sinclair,” she continued, still retaining his hand,
“let me introduce you to my daughter, Mrs. Hardcastle.
Elsie, my love, Mr. Sinclair is a very old friend of mine.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am very glad to see you, sir. I should be glad even
if you were a perfect stranger, but I am very glad to
see an old friend of my mother’s. Do take this chair between
mother and the chimney corner, sir; it is not the
post of honor, perhaps, but it is the most comfortable
and convenient seat, as you can rest and toast your feet
and talk over old times with mother at the same time—old
times, I said. She does not look like she had seen
any very old times, does she, sir?” said Elsie, gayly talking
on, while she shook the hand of the guest and installed
him in his seat.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mamma,—‘Mrs. Garnet of Mount Calm,’—pray take
the entertainment of Mr. Sinclair upon yourself, while I
attend to that for which I have the most talent. I mean
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>the creature comforts. Don’t tell him, mamma, that if
ever I lose my soul through either of the three great
enemies of souls, ‘the world, the flesh, and the devil,’ it
will be by the flesh, for that I have very little of worldliness,
not a whit of diabolism, but a grand passion for
creature comforts,” said Elsie, laughing, as she raised
the lid off the oven. “These biscuits are going to be very
nice,” she remarked, as the steam of the fresh warm
bread greeted their nostrils. She then replaced the lid,
perceived and picked up the fallen hat, gloves, and whip
of the minister, looked at him as the most careless and
slovenly man she ever saw in her life, brushed and put
away the things, and hurried on with her preparations
for supper.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And is this the residence of the wealthy and distinguished
General Garnet’s widow and daughter?” said
Sinclair, in a deep, stern tone, looking around upon the
rough walls.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is the home of General Garnet’s daughter, certainly,
and the temporary home of his wife.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah! I beg your pardon, earnestly—yet—the mistake
was very natural,” said the minister.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hugh, attend to that gentleman’s animal in the very
best manner. Dear Magnus, please to get me some more
wood. Hugh, take the bucket, and, as you come back,
bring me a bucket of water. Dear Magnus, we must
not forget to request the minister to christen our baby.
It may be a long time before we have another opportunity,
and anyhow, I prefer Mr. Sinclair to officiate; it
will be so interesting, he being mother’s old friend,” said
Elsie, as she hurried about, speaking to first one and
then another, attending to everything and forgetting
nothing. Supper was speedily placed upon the table—tea,
fresh butter and eggs, venison, and the nice biscuits.
The minister asked a blessing, but ate little. And soon
after they arose from the table, Mr. Sinclair pleaded fatigue,
and requested to be shown to his room.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dr. Hardcastle attended him to his chamber.</p>

<p class='c010'>When Magnus returned to the family room he found
the tea things had been already washed up and put away,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>the hearth swept, the fire replenished, and the two ladies
with their needlework, and Hugh with his books, all
gathered around the table that was lighted by but one
tallow candle. He drew a chair up with the rest, and,
putting his hand in his pocket, said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have got a letter from Huttontown.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A letter from Huttontown!” exclaimed all three,
looking eagerly up.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, from Mr. Wilson.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What’s the news? How is father?” asked Elsie.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Does he speak of the general? How is he?” inquired
Alice anxiously.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How are all the folks? How is Aunt Joe and Nettie?”
asked Hugh Hutton. All were speaking together,
and all eagerly awaiting an answer.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Peste! ladies and young gentleman, I cannot answer
all at once,” said Magnus, smiling, yet with something
constrained in his manner. “I will read the letter; it is
very short; a mere note—a mere matter of business.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well?” said Alice, seeing him pause.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A mere announcement, in truth—a—but I will read
it. Hugh, you’re discreet?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Elsie, my dear, I have been anxious to submit this
letter to your mother and yourself all the evening.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, well, Magnus. My mother is on thorns, and I
am scarcely more at ease. Has anything happened?
You look ‘perplexed, yet not in despair’—not like the
recipient of very ill news.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, no, not of ill news, yet strange news. You
know before I came away from Huttontown the last
time I requested the Rev. Mr. Wilson to inform me immediately
by letter of anything important that might occur
at Mount Calm, and concern us.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, yes. Well?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He has done so. Here is his letter—listen.”</p>

<div class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>Huttontown</span>, January, 18—.</div>

<p class='c016'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Dr. Hardcastle</span>: At our last interview you
desired me, in the event of General Garnet’s contemplating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>any second matrimonial engagement, to inform you,
by letter, without delay, saying that it vitally concerned
the welfare of all parties that this should instantly
be done. Without having the most remote idea of the
cause of your very emphatic instructions, I hasten to
obey them, by advising you that General Garnet and
Miss Wylie of Point Pleasant are to be married on Tuesday
next. Nothing is talked of but the match and the
great preparations making for the wedding at Point
Pleasant, and for the reception of the bride at Mount
Calm. The family of the lady seem very well pleased
with the match. Ulysses Roebuck, the jilted lover, has
gone—sailed for Europe, with the purpose of making the
grand tour.</p>

<p class='c016'>“There, you have the facts that most interest you.
There is nothing else stirring; all the same dull, dead
level; a birth, death, or marriage would be an historical
event in this village.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Good Heaven! There, what did I tell you, Elsie!”
exclaimed Alice, clasping her hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My dear mother! my darling mother! never mind.
There is one love on earth that shall never fail you. I
can have no second mother,” said Elsie, rising and throwing
her arms around the lady’s neck.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Magnus, you see that I must go. I must write to-night,
to prepare him for my arrival, and to-morrow I
must set out myself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, no, mother; don’t go! It will be worse than ever
now in your old home. Oh, mamma, don’t go! Write—only
write. Or if it be indispensable that someone go,
Magnus will. Will you not, Magnus?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will do whatever your mother wishes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then, dearest Magnus, mail my letter to-night, even
late as it is, and prepare to set out with me to-morrow.
Yet, no: you must not leave Elsie. Prepare me a way
to go alone.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>“Dear Mrs. Garnet, dear friend, I implore you not to
think of going. I will go myself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Magnus, dear, you know that upon some points I
can be stubborn. I must go straight to Mount Calm,”
said Alice.</p>

<p class='c010'>And despite all arguments and entreaties, she persisted
in her resolution.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then, since you will go, I shall attend you to the end
of your journey, and—bring you back—perhaps.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But, Elsie; you cannot leave her alone and unprotected
at home.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She will not be alone; Hugh will be with her; and for
protection, my brave wife can protect herself, if necessary.
Pooh! my dear madam, I would leave Elsie here
in the heart of the wilderness six months, if needful,
without fear or hesitation. She is one in a million, our
Elsie. What say you, dear Elsie?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I say—go with mother if you love me, Magnus. See
her safe to her journey’s end, and, if it be possible, bring
her safe back to me again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>That same night Alice’s letter was written and mailed.</p>

<p class='c010'>The next morning, at an early hour Alice Garnet set
out, under the protection of Dr. Hardcastle, for the East.</p>

<p class='c010'>An hour later, when the Rev. Mr. Sinclair arose and
came down to breakfast, Mrs. Hardcastle tendered him
the compliments and excuses of his host, informing him
that a domestic affair of vital moment called Mrs. Garnet
suddenly to Mount Calm, whither Dr. Hardcastle was instantly
obliged to attend her.</p>

<p class='c010'>After breakfast the minister, leaving his respects and
adieus for the absentees, took leave and proceeded on
his journey.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was two days before the appointed wedding day, and
General Garnet sat in his library, over his wine, in deep
consultation with his lawyer.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And, you say, sir, that my will might be successfully
contested?” he asked, setting down his empty glass, and
looking anxiously, half angrily, at the attorney.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I give it, sir, as my best digested legal opinion, that
in the event of your death, should the will by which you
bequeath all this vast property to your adopted daughter
be contested, it would probably be set aside in favor of
Alice Chester Hardcastle, the only living representative
of the old Chester family, who have held the land from
the first settlement of the country to the present time—upward
of two hundred years. You know, sir, that the
decision of the case would rest finally with the jury, and
such are the prejudices in favor of wealth, rank, hereditary
descent, and——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well! speak out—justice, you would add, I suppose,”
said General Garnet, filling his glass and passing the
bottle.</p>

<p class='c010'>The lawyer bowed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, sir! what of these prejudices? Finish your
sentence.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That scarce a jury could be found to give a verdict
against your legal daughter—a Chester—and in favor of
your—I beg your pardon—adopted daughter—a stranger
and an alien.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sir, you know nothing of the law. I shall seek better
legal advice,” exclaimed General Garnet, bringing down
his glass upon the table with a force that shivered it, and
rising in an excited manner.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You may seek other, and find more palatable advice,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>sir. Our consultation ends here. I wish you good-evening,
sir,” said the lawyer, rising and going to the
door.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Stay!” said General Garnet, going after him.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the attorney bowed deeply and retired.</p>

<p class='c010'>General Garnet continued to pace up and down the
floor, with a strange, excited manner, totally at variance
with his usual serene self-possession. Frequently, also,
he stopped—poured out and quaffed a glass of wine. At
last, pausing, he struck his forehead, emphatically
exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have it, now! a deed! To-morrow morning, the
first thing I do will be to have drawn up, sign, seal, and
record a deed of conveyance, giving the whole of this
estate to Garnet Seabright, and retaining only a life interest
in it myself. Yes! a deed! There will be no contesting
or setting aside that, I fancy. And whether I die
next year, or a hundred years hence, Nettie, if she lives,
becomes possessed of all this property. Yes! yes! I must
revenge myself upon Hardcastle. I must punish that ungrateful
daughter—true scion of the stubborn Chesters.
And by all means, by any means—I must—will!—elevate
and aggrandize Nettie—my child, my darling, my darling,
the only thing on earth that loves me. Yes! elevate
and aggrandize her until I force the world to recognize
her. Nettie, my heart’s core! whose thought has power
to banish even the image of my young bride from my
mind!—to banish it, because fair and lovely and loving as
she is—her fantastical and selfish passion, flattering as it
is—is a more selfish thing than your sweet affection, my
darling child. Yet she is beautiful, this fervid Ambrosia!
And once this business settled—this deed that
secures wealth and rank to my Nettie, executed and recorded,
I shall be free to yield up soul and senses to this
dream of passion. How my thoughts wander! I am
giddy. I am not well. When ever did I talk to myself
before? I must stop this. I will consult a physician to-morrow,”
said General Garnet, sitting down, and drinking
great draughts of wine.</p>

<p class='c010'>The next day, true to his purpose, he rode to Huttontown,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>and had the deed of conveyance, giving all the
great Mount Calm property to Garnet Seabright, and reserving
only a life interest in it himself, drawn up, signed,
and witnessed with all legal formulæ. Then he rode with
it himself to the county town, and had it recorded. In the
course of the day the slight indications of approaching
illness that had visited him the night before returned,
and now, with more marked emphasis. Sudden vertigo,
with failure of sight and confusion of thought, would
seize him an instant, pass away—return again, and again
pass. He drew up his horse at last before a doctor’s office,
entered, sat down, and apologizing for troubling the
physician with such a trifling indisposition by saying,
jestingly, that he wished to be in perfect health upon his
wedding day—he related his symptoms.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is nothing, sir,” said the physician, after he had
felt his pulse, etc. “It is nothing. Do not be alarmed, I
beseech you! Keep a calm mind; it is of vital importance
that you keep a calm mind. I would advise you to defer
your marriage for a few weeks.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you think, sir, that I am threatened with——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, sir! Oh, no, there is not the least occasion for
alarm; these symptoms must yield to a very little judicious
treatment. Abstain from the use of wine and
stimulating food, and, above all things, avoid all agitation
and excitement; keep from all places and persons
that have the least effect upon your nerves. A day or so
will set you up again. Stay, I will write you a little prescription.
Here, sir, take this—it is simply a cooling
draught; follow directions, and all will be right.”</p>

<p class='c010'>General Garnet took the scrap of paper, bowed, and
withdrew, with a contemptuous smile upon his lips, muttering
to himself:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Fool that I am, to seek medical advice of a fellow
whose interest it is to make and keep me ill for a month
or so! Shall I take this prescription, now? No, I feel
better already. The fresh air has revived me. I will go
to Point Pleasant and spend the evening with Ambrosia;
her sweet smile and gentle touch will charm this fitful
illness.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>And turning his horse’s head, General Garnet took the
road to Judge Wylie’s. The sky was clouding up, but,
heedless of the threatened rain, he rode on rapidly to
Point Pleasant. He spent a long, delightful evening
with Miss Wylie, and left, at a late hour, more intoxicated
than ever with the alluring beauty of his promised bride,
and repeating, in an impassioned tone, many times, the
words of his parting: “To-morrow! oh, to-morrow, Ambrosia.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He faced a cold and driving rain all the way home, and
arrived at his own gate, dripping wet.</p>

<p class='c010'>Throwing the reins of his horse to an attendant, he
hastened into the house. The voice of Nettie greeted
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Here, godfather! come in here to the library; here is
a good fire, and your dressing-gown and slippers all
warm, and hot coffee and oysters and wine. I made them
for you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Divesting himself of his wet overcoat, cap, leggings,
and gloves, he walked into the library, where he found
Nettie presiding over the comforts she had prepared for
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My dear little brownie! Why are you up so late?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The rain waked me up, godfather, and then I couldn’t
sleep any more for thinking you were out in it. So I got
up and dressed myself, and came down here to make
things comfortable for you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My own Nettie! I have been making things comfortable
for you, also! But where is your granny?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gone to bed these two hours.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And now you must go, my dear little one. Come
and kiss me close, and then, good-night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The elf sprang to his neck, squeezing him tightly, and
rooting herself into his bosom, as though she would
grow there, and then suddenly springing off, bounded
from the room.</p>

<p class='c010'>The little supper standing before him did not tempt
his appetite. With another retrospective glance of contempt
at the physician’s advice, he turned to the table
and poured out and swallowed glass after glass of wine.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>Then, without heeding the mail-bag that hung upon the
chair, or ringing for a servant to clear off the things, or
even closing up the house, as was his invariable custom,
he arose and retired to his chamber.</p>

<hr class='c011'>

<p class='c010'>At this same hour, on the turnpike road, about six
miles distant from Mount Calm, plunged on through
darkness, mire, and driving rain, a one-horse chaise, occupied
by two travelers—Dr. Hardcastle and Mrs. Garnet.
They traveled on in perfect silence for two hours
before reaching the grounds of Mount Calm. But, upon
passing the outer gate and entering upon the premises,
Alice became nervous and uneasy, and at length she
asked:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Magnus, do you feel positively assured that he has
received my letter, that he is prepared and expecting to
see me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Without a doubt, dear Mrs. Garnet, he got your letter
to-day at noon; assuredly, late as it is, he must be now
expecting us.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wonder if he really does. I wonder if he has spread
the news among the people of the plantation! It is really
necessary to know, dear Magnus. Else my sudden and
unexpected apparition among them will cause a general
alarm and rouse the neighborhood.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Very true, and at the first quarter I come to I will
alight and find out.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They rode on in silence until they came to a solitary
quarter on the outskirts of the plantation. Then Dr.
Hardcastle, alighting, gave the reins to Mrs. Garnet, and
trudged through the deep mud and pelting rain to the
cabin from whence a faint light issued, and the low, sweet
sound of a violin was heard. He rapped smartly with the
handle of his riding whip. The music ceased, and a voice,
which he recognized as belonging to Bob, the driver,
called out from within:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hoo dar, rappin’ at my door dis onseasonable hour
o’ de night?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Me, Bob! your old friend, Dr. Hardcastle; open the
door and show yourself.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>“Oh, my Gor A’mighty, Marse Magnate, is it you,
sure ’nough, come from forrin parts?” ejaculated the old
negro, fumbling at the wooden latch and wrenching open
the door. “Come in, come in—come in, Marse Magnate,
come in. Oh, blessed Lor’! I’m so joyed to see
you. How is Miss Elsie! she long o’ you? Come in!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, Bob, I cannot come in. I am going straight on
to the house. Elsie is not with me; she is at home, and—well,
I can’t come in. I only called by to see you, my
old friend, and to ask you if all were well at the house,
and if anything new had happened.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All well dar, honey, ’deed dey is, fus’ rate. Nuffin
new, honey, ’cept ’tis Marse I’on g’wne be marry to Miss
Ambush Wylie to-morrow night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah! Well, I wrote to General Garnet to say that I
was coming to-night; is he expecting me, do you
know?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“’Deed he got de letter, honey, caze I fotch it from de
pos’ office myself dis mornin’, an’ de pos’ marser said how
it war from out yonder where you gone to. But I never
hear General I’on say nuffin ’bout ’spectin’ no one to de
weddin’, ’deed I didn’t, honey. Let me run along to de
house an’ rouse ’em all up and tell ole marse how you’ve
come.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, by no means, Bob. Thank you, good-night,”
said Dr. Hardcastle, jumping into the carriage.</p>

<p class='c010'>“All right, he has received your letter, madam; but has
not imparted its contents to anyone. He is doubtless
expecting you momentarily; but as no one else is, your
sudden appearance would strike a panic to the household,
suddenly roused up out of their sleep, or perhaps
send them all shrieking from the plantation.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But would not your presence by my side—they know
you’re alive—reassure them?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My dear Mrs. Garnet, they assisted at your funeral,
twelve months ago, and seeing us enter at midnight together
will sooner believe me to be a second ghost than
you to be a living woman. No, my dear friend, you
must veil yourself closely, and after I have got you into
the house, pass quietly up to General Garnet’s chamber
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>and reveal yourself to him. Here we are at last,” said
Dr. Hardcastle, pulling up before the front door of the
mansion.</p>

<p class='c010'>All was dark except a fitful light that gleamed and
sunk, and gleamed and sunk, from the upper windows of
General Garnet’s chamber—as if a candle was expiring
there in the socket.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It must be near two o’clock—yet he is still sitting up
for me—see there,” whispered Alice, pointing to the
flashing and darkening light.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He must be alone, and have dropped asleep by that
expiring light,” murmured Magnus, as he led her up the
stairs to the front door. “Now, courage, my dear
friend. Remember that in me you have a protector near
you,” whispered Dr. Hardcastle, as he fumbled about in
the dark for the knocker. In doing so the door swung
silently open—it had evidently been left ajar. They entered
noiselessly. The hall was perfectly dark and silent;
no sound was heard but the moan of the wind and the
heavy fall of the rain without. “Now, dearest Alice, he
has evidently left the door ajar that you might enter without
rousing the servants, and make your way at once to
his chamber, where he awaits you. Go on—yet! stay! I
do not like the looks of this thing, either. No one
knows of your existence—no one knows that you were
expected here; he awaits you alone in the solitude, silence,
and darkness of deep night. No, Alice! I cannot
let you go alone to his baleful presence—I must attend
you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not for the world, Magnus. What monstrous
thought is in your mind? Does midnight storm and
solitude raise such phantoms of fear in your strong
mind?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Alice! bethink you! he is a man of fearful passions,
yet of profound subtlety and secretiveness. He believed
you dead and was about to be married. He finds that
he has been deceived in your death, and that his own
marriage is about to be ridiculously broken off. He has
imaginary injuries to revenge, and endangered joys to
secure—both ends to be reached by one means. And,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>more than all, he has the fearful temptation of fancied
impunity. Alice, take care! This open door—this silent
house—this lonely watcher in the solitary chamber—this
deep night hour—and the expected lonely visitor. Alice,
take care!” whispered Magnus.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Horrible! most horrible. You make my blood
curdle. Not with fear, but with horror, at the monster
in your imagination. You must not enter with me. I
will go in alone. Follow, if you please to do so, at a
short distance. I have no such dreadful fear or doubt.
I tremble, it is true; but I should also tremble if, in broad
daylight, a score of people witnessed our meeting.
Come on, and remain upon the landing while I go in.”</p>

<hr class='c011'>

<p class='c010'>On entering his chamber General Garnet suddenly bethought
himself of something—he could not exactly
think what—forgotten. A strange absence of mind, temporary
loss of memory, transient confusion of thought,
had fitfully afflicted him all day long. He put his hand
to his forehead, and walked up and down in doubt and
perplexity, then suddenly recollecting what he wanted, he
rang the bell, and when a servant, half-dressed, appeared,
demanded, impatiently:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Anything from the post office to-day, sir?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, marser. Bob, he went to de post office an’
fotch de bag.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then where is it, you scoundrel? and why was it not
brought to me?” stamped the master.</p>

<p class='c010'>“De-ur-ur——” stammered the negro, in fear and perplexity,
scratching his head for an answer.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sir!” thundered General Garnet.</p>

<p class='c010'>And the reply bolted from the lips of the negro as if
thumped out by a blow between his shoulders:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ugh! Yes, sir! You wan’t comed home when it
’riv, marser, an’ I hanged it on a chair by de liberry
table, where you could see it when you comed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And if I had forgotten all about it, as I did, you
scoundrel! Go and bring it to me. Vanish!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man precipitately retreated, and soon reappeared
with the mail-bag, which he placed in the hands of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>master, who immediately opened and turned out its contents.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Only one letter! And that—— D——!” exclaimed
General Garnet, recognizing the handwriting of Magnus
Hardcastle in the superscription of Alice’s letter.
“Here, you sir! Come here!” added he, hastily blotting
out the superscription and re-directing it. “Come here!
take this letter! By the earliest dawn to-morrow take it
back to the post office, that it may be in time for the
mail, and tell the postmaster to send it back where it
came from.” He tossed the letter toward the feet of the
negro, who tremblingly approached, picked it up, and
retired from the chamber.</p>

<p class='c010'>Left alone he paced up and down the floor in troubled
thought, for about the space of an hour. All about the
house was profoundly still; no sound was heard but the
mournful murmur of the wind, and the dreary beating
of the rain. The clock struck twelve, and the strokes fell
through the awful stillness of the night with preternatural
solemnity.</p>

<p class='c010'>“So late! and I not yet calm enough to sleep—fearing
to sleep, almost, lest I should never wake again. What
is this? Why now does the solitude and silence of my
chamber so affect, so appall, me? The truth is, I am
ill! must be, or I should not be so weak. I did not kill
her. No, I did not kill her. I did not take any means
to recover her for hours? Well! what if I did not? That
was not murder! I let her die in her fit for want of
assistance? She might have died anyhow. Why does
her image haunt my bed, driving sleep thence? Oh,
miserable weakness! Oh, cowardice! Would my bitterest
enemy believe it of me? that I dread to look around
me, lest I see her face? It is this that is my illness. Oh,
doctor! can your drugs banish her thoughts? Pshaw!
They say nothing evil can come into the neighborhood
of innocence. Nettie! my Nettie is near me! in the next
room. Surely my reason wanders. What evil could
come nigh me? She was not ‘evil’ on earth. She is
not ‘evil’ in heaven. She would not avenge herself, if
she could. Oh, wretched driveling! What am I talking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>of? I am ill—I must be. It is illness that raises these
phantoms of dread. And solitude and uncommunicated
thoughts and sorrows have caused this illness. Courage!
This is my last lonely night. To-morrow, and ever after
to-morrow, the cheerful face of that fair girl shall banish
all such sickly fancies. To-morrow, and ever after to-morrow.
But to-night I cannot rest at all. I—I will go
and look at Nettie, sleeping; the innocence of slumbering
childhood shall disperse the cloud of devils lowering
over me. Nettie! ‘The sins of the father shall be visited
upon the children——’ I dare not. No! I dare not
now. No! I dare not.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He dropped upon a chair—struck both hands to his
forehead, whence the cold sweat oozed. He sat there,
heedless, while the wind moaned around the house, and
the rain beat drearily against the windows. He sat there,
motionless, until the clock struck one, and the stroke fell
like a knell. He started then, but relapsed, immediately,
into statue-like stillness. The hour passed on, while the
rain still beat, and the wind still moaned. The candle
burned low in its socket, but he did not heed it. It
flashed, filling the room with a strange brilliancy, and
sunk, leaving it in darkness—but he did not heed it. It
flashed and darkened—and flashed and darkened ever—but
he did not heed it.</p>

<p class='c010'>The door swung open—but he did not know it. Alice,
his lost wife, stood within, motionless—pale—but he did
not see her. She gazed at him—growing paler every
instant—she glided toward him—she stood over him—where
he sat, with his face buried in his hands—but he
gave no sign of consciousness. Trembling, pale, and
cold with fear, she laid her icy hands upon him, saying,
in a voice faint and hollow with exhausted emotion:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Aaron, I have come.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He sprang up as if shot; his face ashy pale, his countenance
aghast, hair bristling, eyes starting with horror,
as he exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then such things are! You have taken form at last!
or else—yes—it must be so—I am mad—mad!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Dashing his hands against his forehead, as though to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>shut out a horrible vision, he sunk back again into his
chair.</p>

<p class='c010'>Astonished, terrified, shuddering, Alice approached
again, kneeled by his side, spoke gently, soothingly,
deprecatingly to him.</p>

<p class='c010'>But ere she ceased speaking his hands dropped from
his forehead, his head sank upon his bosom, his form
swayed to and fro an instant, and then he fell forward,
prostrate, at the feet of his wife.</p>

<p class='c010'>A succession of violent screams from Alice brought
Dr. Hardcastle rushing in at one door, and Nettie, in
her nightgown, flying in at the other.</p>

<p class='c010'>They gathered around the fallen man. They raised
him, set him in his chair.</p>

<p class='c010'>General Garnet was dead.</p>

<hr class='c011'>

<p class='c010'>After that the wild shrieks of a distracted child, refusing
to be comforted, filled the house of death.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>It was the morning of Garnet Seabright’s majority,
when she was to come into possession of the vast estate
given her by her adopted father, and she was expecting
a visit from her trustee to give an account of his stewardship
and yield up his office.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lionel Hardcastle, foreordained by General Garnet as
the husband of his inheritrix, had been appointed trustee
of the estate and guardian of the heiress, and of—his
own interests at the same time.</p>

<p class='c010'>And well had he fulfilled his trust; no Eastern despot
had even established a stricter guard over a young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>Georgian maid than did this guardian over the heiress.
At the early age of twelve he had placed her at a strict
convent school, where she avowed that she had to eat,
drink, and sleep; pray, sing, and learn lessons; sit, stand,
and walk by exact rule. We may fancy the effect of such
a discipline upon our wild child. The fleet deer of the
mountain penned, the free bird of the air caged, was
nothing to this wild child of sea and land confined! At
first she was anxious to go; for all children like change;
but at the first visit of her guardian, whom with her confiding
nature she already loved, she sprang upon his lap,
threw her arms around his neck, entreated, prayed, wept
to be taken away; and when she found her vehement
solicitations vain, she passionately dashed her hand into
his face, called him an evil spirit, sprang from his arms,
and threw herself face downward flat upon the floor;
called the good sisterhood a pack of witches, with Hecate
at their head, and threatened to starve herself to death,
as the partridge did she tried to tame once; and so, by
this conduct, got herself into disgrace for a week. There
is great adaptativeness in childhood, and in time our
little girl became reconciled to her convent, especially as
the gentle nuns took an affectionate interest in civilizing
the little barbarian, who, notwithstanding her faults,
drew all hearts to herself. The effect of this conventual
education was altogether good. It cultivated and directed
the powers of her intellect and moral sense, and
taught her to control the almost savage strength and
daring of her passionate and energetic nature. But she
left the convent distinguished by the same inflexibility
of will with which she had entered its walls. By the will
of her adopted father she was not to marry until she
had attained the age of twenty-one, and though then
her choice was not absolutely controlled, it was directed
to her guardian. It was upon this account, and to seclude
her from society and the chance of forming another
attachment, that, despite the conscientious expostulations
of the Mother Superior, he left her boarding
at the convent until she had nearly reached her twentieth
birthday. About that time Miss Seabright became
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>inspired with a desire to see the world—not society, but
the earth and all thereon; so, without asking any favors,
she expressed her will to leave the convent and travel for
a year. This proposition well suited the views of her
guardian, as it obviated the awkward necessity of leaving
her in the convent, or the impolitic alternative of introducing
her into society, and gave him an admirable opportunity
of pressing his suit, and even imposing upon
her the inevitable propriety of accepting him.</p>

<p class='c010'>They made the tour of Europe together, journeying
over the kindred soil of Old England, the “sunny land”
of France, the old chivalric mountains of Spain, the
classic plains of Italy and Greece, the Alpine precipices
of Switzerland; along the forest, rock, and castle-shadowed
rivers of Germany; over the snow-clad plains of
Russia, and thence down amid the mosques and seraglios
of Turkey. By Mr. Hardcastle’s position and connection
in America, and his letters of presentation to our
ministers abroad, he might have obtained introduction
for himself and ward into the best society of every capital
in Europe, but it did not suit his policy to do so. And
even when her love of travel was somewhat sated, and
Miss Seabright expressed a desire to enter the world of
society, he put her off from time to time with various
excuses. As her wish to mingle with the world was not
very strong, she did not insist. And thus at the end of
thirteen months’ travel in Europe Miss Seabright set out
on her return home as “innocent of the knowledge” of
the world as when she had left her convent walls. She
had had the opportunity of studying deeply but one
specimen of human nature, and him she had well learned—her
guardian and traveling companion, Lionel Hardcastle.
Repeatedly had he pressed his suit, and eloquently
had he pleaded the passion with which his recent
intimate association with the unique and beautiful
girl had inspired him. And repeatedly, amid protestations
of gratitude and friendship, had she lamented her
utter inability to meet his love. He bided his time!</p>

<p class='c010'>It was in this relative position that the guardian and
ward returned to Mount Calm early in the spring of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>18—. Miss Seabright had indulged her love of luxury
with the purchase of elegant furniture in France. These
had been transported to Mount Calm, where the mansion
house had been superbly fitted up for the reception
of its young mistress.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was then a fine day in the month of March that Miss
Seabright sat in her library, awaiting the arrival of her
guardian.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Lionel Hardcastle!” announced a servant,
throwing open the door. Miss Seabright seated herself
before the library table, and Mr. Lionel Hardcastle entered
the library, accompanied by old Mr. Hardcastle, his
father, and a lawyer.</p>

<p class='c010'>A half hour was occupied in the reading and transferring
of certain documents, of which the lawyer finally
took charge.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then the gentlemen got up to take leave. Miss Seabright
also arose, to dismiss them; but when she saw
that Lionel Hardcastle was about to bow the others out
with the purpose of remaining himself, she courteously
advanced, and invited them all to remain and dine. A
quick telegraphic look from Lionel Hardcastle to his
father arrested the old gentleman’s intention of accepting,
so that, excusing himself, he took leave and withdrew,
followed by the lawyer. Miss Seabright also followed,
with the intention of leaving the library, but
Lionel Hardcastle intercepted her purpose by bowing
the gentlemen out, and closing the door after them.
Miss Seabright retreated to the library table, where she
stood erect, with one hand resting upon the table, and
with her fiery eyes concentrating all their rays into a
burning focus in the gaze she fixed upon his face. Yet
he winced not; but advancing calmly toward her, said:
“That attitude and gaze, Miss Seabright, would remind
me that my authority as your guardian ceases from this
hour.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Without referring to that circumstance, Mr. Hardcastle,
I would only plead excessive weariness of this
room, and to be excused for the remainder of the day.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You do not look in the least fatigued; and just now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>you even invited my father and your lawyer to remain
and dine with you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And extended the same invitation to yourself; which
I now repeat. Will you now accept it, and excuse me
for an hour’s repose until dinner time?” she asked
calmly—calmly, yet he could see by those dark eyes,
which blazed and darkened under their heavy lids like
a flashing and expiring flame, that under that quiet exterior,
volcanic passion stirred, threatening every instant
to break out in destroying fury, and only restrained by
the force of her own will and the power of her own moral
sense.</p>

<p class='c010'>He folded his arms, and gazed on her; his look was
resolved, his face was ashen pale, all the strength and
fire of his nature seemed concentrated and burning in
his eyes, and in the gaze he fixed upon her face. He
answered, slowly, “No, Miss Seabright; there is no repose
for me, shall be none for you, until you hear me.
I will not leave this room, nor suffer you to leave it, until
you hear me. Hitherto you have disregarded your
benefactor’s expressed will and wishes, contemned my
claims, despised my love.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your ‘love’? Is yours the language or the deportment
of love?” she asked, in the deep, stern tone of suppressed
indignation.</p>

<p class='c010'>His manner suddenly changed; and from insolent and
threatening, became submissive and deprecating. He
dashed his hands suddenly against his forehead, then
threw himself at her feet, seized her hands and dropping
his head upon them, almost wept, exclaiming: “No, no,
Garnet! mine were not the words or acts of love, but of
‘love to frenzy driven.’ I forswear them. Pardon me,
pardon me. Garnet, I love you! I adore you! I worship
you! Not that you have beauty, grace, genius—all
these I have seen in other women, with an undisturbed
heart—but there is a unique power in your look that
draws me to you; there is a fire in your soul and in your
eyes that draws me to you as the sun attracts the earth.
Daughter of the sun you are indeed, with all his reddish
rays concentrated in your being, as in the burning gem,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>your family namesake. Garnet, oh, Garnet, I rave still,
and more insanely than before. Garnet, restore peace,
calmness, self-possession, and reason to my soul! Give
your peerless self to me! Be my salvation! Speak to
me! Answer me! Say something, oh, dear Garnet!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Her lightning anger, quick to subside as to flash forth,
had died away. As he held her hands, kissing them and
almost weeping over them, she answered, in a low voice:
“Alas! Mr. Hardcastle, what shall I say? What can I
say, that I have not said with pain before this? I feel
honored by your esteem; I feel grateful for your love;
I feel humbled that I cannot return it. It is no disparagement
to you—it is a misfortune, perhaps, to me—that
I cannot do so. One cannot always admire what
may be admirable, or esteem what may be estimable, still
less can they always love what is lovable. Yet I am disposed
to entertain a profound friendship for you. My
dear guardian, cease then to torment yourself and me
farther with this question. I cannot marry,” she said,
gently but firmly, as she sank into the chair behind her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Cannot marry!” he repeated, rising and throwing
himself upon a sofa near her. “Cannot marry! Have
you then made a vow of celibacy? Has your convent
education imbued you with that notion?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No; Heaven forbid! I have formed no resolution of
leading a single life. I should not be happy in such a
destiny, should not even if I were already blessed with
father and mother, sisters and brothers, cousins and
friends—how could I possibly expect to be, standing perfectly
alone as I do? I have a sisterly affection for you—not
love! There be many affections; but only one love!
only one—marriage.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He had restrained himself as long as it was possible to
do so. He now started from the sofa where he had reclined,
watching her with pale cheeks and burning gaze,
and, starting toward her with clenched fist, he exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, haughty girl, you speak truth; there is but one
marriage—for you! You are compelled to marry me!
The world expects it of you. Is not the will of your
benefactor known? Are we not generally supposed to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>betrothed? Did we not make the tour of Europe alone
together? The world expects you to marry me. And
you will forever lose the respect of the world by failing
to do so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Her brow crimsoned, her eyes blazed. She arose to
her feet and answered slowly:</p>

<p class='c010'>“And I would rather lose the respect of the world by
rejecting you than deserve to lose it by accepting you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Fool! Have you no regard for your reputation?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; but think it wrong to secure good reputation at
the expense of good character.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What paradox, what nonsense is that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh! they are not synonymous terms, character and
reputation; on earth they never have been, on earth they
never will be. Often they are antagonistic words.
Many of the heroes and martyrs of history, the demigods
of our adoration, were men of the best characters, with—while
they lived—the worst reputations.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then you have no respect for the good opinion of
the world?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes! my aspiring heart! too much, I fear, for my
soul’s good; and I know, I know by all the glorious
gifts of Heaven to me, I know by all my mighty power
for good or ill, by all my absolute unswerving will to
good, I know that I have a right and title, Heaven-patented,
not to the passive good opinion, but to the
honor, the co-operation of the world.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And I tell you, haughty woman, as you stand here
a very goddess of pride, I tell you as you stand here beneath
these halls, where you should never have stood,
invested with all this power, that you should never have
possessed, armed with the might of vast wealth and of
high talent, arrayed in the magic charms of young
womanhood and perfect beauty—I tell you, that you are
now—naught that you will be, unless you marry me—a
suspected, proscribed, banned, outcast woman!” He
expected this to overwhelm her. But she turned her
large, dark, solemn eyes, solemn now with prophetic inspiration,
upon him, and inquired calmly:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>“Listen, girl. You are ambitious, arrogant, scornful.
Yet a few words from me will subdue all that, by showing
you that you are obliged to marry me. Attend! we
made the tour of Europe alone together, putting up at
the same hotels, having a common parlor, a common
table, a common carriage——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, sir! That is easily understood in guardian and
ward.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not when the guardian is a man of thirty-seven and
the ward a girl of twenty; not when</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Both are young and one is beautiful,’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>he added sneeringly. “Often, you know it, we were
mistaken for a married pair——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And for brother and sister,” she added, the blood
mounting to her brow.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Which we were not. Now attend! All that familiarity
may be understood in a guardian and ward,
who are, besides, known to be betrothed to each other,
and who keep their tacit promise to society by marriage.
Now, listen! if you should not consent to marry me——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If I do not! I will not. There is no if.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then all your beauty, wealth, and talent, with all the
power they give you, avail you nothing. You are an
outcast!”</p>

<p class='c010'>She dropped into her chair again, she paled even to
her lips, the fire died out of her eyes, and even from
every lurid ring of her dark, bright hair. He gazed at
her ironically, saying slowly:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah! you do not care for the opinion of the world.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do I not?” she exclaimed, with sudden and impassioned
energy, “do I not aspire to the honor of all the
world? Do I not know and feel by all that I am and
have, and by all that I purpose to do and to be, that I
have a God-given patent to such honor? Has not my
soul prophesied it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And I repeat to you, haughty woman, that unless
you marry me, you will not have it. Your powers are
all paralyzed.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>She dropped her hands upon her lap, her head upon
her bosom, in the collapse of despair.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ha! trapped, palsied, helpless!” he exclaimed exultingly.
“Where is now your vaunted independence?
your pride? your scorn? Gone! quite gone! Why, so
much the better. You will make the better wife for the
loss of that. Come, Garnet, I love you; could worship
your beauty, sometimes, only that it seems to spoil you;
come, I love you. Let us cease this absurd quarrel and
be friends. Come, do not look so despairingly. Harsh
and stern as I may be when threatened with your loss, I
shall not make such a bad husband. And for the rest—bless
me, girl, you know my family and my standing—shall
I be such a very ill match for General Garnet’s——”</p>

<p class='c010'>He paused, and she raised her deathlike brow, and,
wiping the cold drops of sweat from its pallid surface,
said slowly, and with profound sadness:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh-h-h! You miserably misconceive my grief. It
is this that overwhelms me; it is the thought of
your——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Villainy! Speak out, I will relieve you!” he said
sarcastically.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I did not mean to use the word.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Policy, then! for it was no more nor less; only
finish.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is this, then, that crushes me with sorrow—the
knowledge that you, my only protector, who should have
warned my inexperience against the least social mistake,
and shielded my good name from the slightest chance of
injury; that you, my guardian, having perfect authority
over me, and indisputable control of all my actions; that
you, my friend, having my perfect confidence and affection,
that you should have abused that authority, betrayed
that confidence, and wounded that affection by
leading me into a course of conduct pre-calculated, pre-contrived,
to fetter my choice in woman’s dearest privilege,
or to blast my fair fame and palsy my powers of
usefulness forever!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Rave on! be abusive, scornful, insulting as you please.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>But I tell you, arrogant woman, that he whom you
abuse, insult, and scorn will be your husband yet.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And I tell you, insolent man!” she exclaimed, starting
to her feet with all the fire of her nature burning in
her cheeks, and blazing in her eyes, “I tell you that,
wronged, suspected, proscribed, outcast as I may be; and
add to that, poor, friendless, ill, persecuted, desolate as I
may be, I could not fall so low as to become the wife of
the wretch you are. I repel your pretensions with scorn
and loathing. Begone!”</p>

<p class='c010'>He gazed at her in speechless amazement. Was this
incarnate storm, his ward? the dignified, self-restraining,
self-governing Miss Seabright? Yes, the violent passions
of her nature, restrained for many years, had now burst
the bonds of moral power. The volcanic tide of fire that
had ebbed and flowed, and been repressed through all
this scene, had now broken forth in appalling power.
Her form was erect—her nostrils dilated—her brow
was crimson, her eyes blazed and darkened, and blazed
and darkened with terrific rapidity.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Begone!” she thundered; “out of my sight, or by the
Heaven that made me, I will summon my slaves and
have you thrust forth with contumely from my gates!”
Her hand was on the bell, her insane purpose was indubitable.</p>

<p class='c010'>With a gesture of desperation he rushed from the
room.</p>

<p class='c010'>She gazed after him until he had closed the door.
She stood motionless a long, long time, while the tide of
fire ebbed; then, sinking with the reaction of the exhaustion
and self-reproach, she covered her face with
her hands, murmuring in heart-broken tones, “God pity
me! God forgive me! What a nature is mine! With
a heart and bosom torn, tortured, convulsed by storms
of ferocious anger, scorn, and pride, yet with a spirit
brooding highly, calmly over all—as above the clouds,
and thunder, and lightning of the earth shine the holy
stars of heaven.”</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Her wretched brain gave way,</div>
      <div class='line'>And she became a wreck at random driven,</div>
      <div class='line'>Without one glimpse of reason or of Heaven.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Long remained Miss Seabright with her head bowed
upon her hand in bitter thought. Twice a servant came
and announced dinner without her seeing or hearing
him. The third time, when he approached and spoke
close to her ear, she raised her head languidly and said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ask Miss Joe to dine without me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And when Miss Joe herself came in with anxious inquiries
about her health, and affectionate offers of tea
and toast and jellies, she answered, with a bitter smile:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, be easy, dear friend; a little fasting will not hurt
my flesh and blood!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Day waned, and still she maintained her silent and
thoughtful posture. Night came, and a servant entered
with candles. The glare of light aroused her, and, looking
up, she saw the dark face of the man turned ashen
gray with fear. “What is the matter, Cæsar?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Light on de island, miss; you kin see it plain as star
a-shinin’!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Light on the island? Well, I will go and see myself.
Where can this light be seen from?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“From the garret window, miss, sure as you’re born.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Go on before me,” she said, rising from her recumbent
posture, and following the man up the several
flight of stairs to the attic.</p>

<p class='c010'>Arrived there, in the very front room where Elsie had
been a prisoner on the last night of her stay at Mount
Calm, they paused.</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Seabright advanced to the window, threw it up,
and looked out at the clear, brilliant, starlight night.
There was not a breath of wind stirring. The air was
still and cold. The rolling hills and plains white with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>snow, and intersected only by the belt of forest around
the foot of Mount Calm, reached silently on to the dark
boundary of the sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, I see no light at sea; none anywhere except
the myriad lights of stars in heaven!” said Miss Seabright,
letting down the window.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Bress your soul, miss, no more you can’t; leastwise
you puts out de candle and looks t’rough the spyglass!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, here’s a fellow who, not having causes of trouble
enough near him, must put out the light and take a
telescope to find out distant ones! Well, set the candle
outside the door, and give me the glass.” And taking
the telescope she went again to the window and hoisted
it. “Yes,” she said, after taking sight, “yes, there is
a light shining still and clear, and apparently fixed near
the ruins of the old lodge!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, it can be seen plain as possible from the village,”
said Miss Joe, who now entered, followed by other members
of the household.</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Seabright closed the window, and, turning to the
assembled group, said, with her singular smile:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, now, this is really a very small affair for conjecture,
and could interest none but a country family in
the depth of winter. Let us go downstairs. It is probably
some poor, lone soul, who, having no shelter, has
put together the ruins of the old lodge and lives there
and supports himself by fishing and shooting.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” said Miss Joe, “that might be well enough,
and nobody thinks nothing of it, only you see, honey, the
folks from the village have been over on the island in
the broad daytime searching, and they can’t find the
leastest signs of human habitations; the poor, dear old
lodge is more tumble-downder than ever, as in course
it must naturally be every winter, with no one to keep the
dear, old crippled thing on its legs. Lord, child, the
neighbors from Huttontown found all so desolute that
the very stars of heaven were shining down into the water
collected in the cellar. No roof, no chimneys, no floors
even; nothing but the lonesome, desolute walls and the
stagnant cellar. They didn’t find anybody, nor any sign
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>of anybody, though they searched all over the island—but,
mind, that was at sunset, and that night about dark
the light blazed up there as bright as ever!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why did not the neighbors go and search then?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“They did. They got into the boats and rowed
straight back, watching the ghostly light all the time,
and just afore they landed it was out.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did they carry a light in their boats?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Certain.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then the great problem is solved. It was some fugitive
slave, a refugee on the island, who, seeing the approach
of the boats by the lights they carried, extinguished
his light and concealed himself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“As if he could. Lor’, child, where could he hide
away on that island? All plain and bare, and bleak as it
is; no bit o’ woods, no hollow; nothing but the outside
walls o’ the old lodge, with its cellar full o’ water, and
the lonesome, bare trees standin’ far apart like ghosts.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“True, very true; there is not a hiding place possible
on the island. But I cling to the thought of the fugitive
refugee, who, seeing the invaders, probably extinguished
his light and took boat for the open sea.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, honey, that w’a’nt it. Bless you, they thought of
that at once, and lit more pine knots, and separated, and
run all around the coast of the little islet, and flashed
their lights about, and couldn’t see sign of a boat on the
waters.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then I am at the end of conjecture. Come, let us
go down. It is cold up here. Take up the candle,
Cæsar,” said Miss Seabright, turning to go from the
room.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, let’s go down; it is so cold up here. And supper’s
ready in the little red parlor. That’s what I come
to tell you, when these niggers all followed me. I told
Milly, long as you hadn’t eat any dinner, and felt sort o’
low spirited, to get supper airly, and br’il a pair of
pa’tridges. A cup o’ good, strong Young Hyson tea,
with light biscuits and br’iled pa’tridges, is very good for
lowness o’ spirits. I knows it, ’cause I’ve tried it myself.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>They hurried through the bleak passages, and downstairs.</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Seabright, preceded by the servant bearing the
candle, and followed by the old lady, entered the parlor.
The comfortable little parlor, with its thick carpet, heavy
curtains, soft sofa, bright fire, and elegant tea-table,
was certainly a specific for mere low spirits. The old
lady bustled past Garnet, and set the urn upon the table,
burning her fingers slightly, and rubbing them, while
she exclaimed cheerily:</p>

<p class='c010'>“There now, sit down. As there’s no one here but
you and me, you know, you can draw the end of the
sofy to the table and loll on that, while I pour out your
tea and butter you a biscuit. Cæsar, you cut up that
pa’tridge for your young mist’ess—not that one, you
stupid creetur! t’other one, it’s the plumpest. Now you
see, honey, the maids have got through their day’s work,
for a wonder, and I have got time to stay in the parlor
and enjoy myself ’long o’ you. And so we’ll have a
jolly good evening; you can loll on the sofa and enjoy
yourself with your low spirits and cologne bottle—only
don’t waste it—and I can sit here and patch my old
gown, and talk about old times.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Garnet looked at the good-natured face of the old
lady, and felt compunction for the answer she was about
to make.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am sorry to spoil the plan of your evening’s entertainment,
Miss Joe, but I am going to explore Hutton’s
Island to-night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Going to explore Hutton’s Island to-night!” exclaimed
Miss Joe, dropping knife and fork, and staring
at her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Lord have mercy upon her! I’ve been havin’
of my misgivin’s all this time, but now I know she’s a
little deranged!” said Miss Joe to herself. Then speaking
aloud, in something of the tone one would take in
addressing a sick and delirious child, “No, no, honey,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>don’t think of it! You’re sick, you know, and it is cold
and dark and dangerous. Then, it isn’t proper for a
young lady to do such a thing, anyhow!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Seabright smiled a queer smile, as she replied:</p>

<p class='c010'>“For the first objections, my good old friend, cowardice
is not one of my weaknesses; for the last”—she
paused and her smile deepened in meaning—“I made a
start in life by quite innocently perpetrating a heinous,
a fatal—crime? no, impropriety! I broke no law of God
or man; yet I am told that for all that I shall be banished
from society unless I do commit a sin, in open
day, in the face of society; who will then forgive
me!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mad! mad!” said Miss Joe to herself, gazing at the
ironical girl.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well!</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘What’s <i>banished</i> but yet free?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>I will do whatever I please—conventional or unconventional!
I will break no law of God’s or man’s, and
after that is said, all is said for me. For the rest, I will
do whatever my spirit impels me to do, whether the
world likes it or not!” said Garnet, speaking more to
herself than to another, and rising and ringing the bell.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mad! mad! mad! and getting worse every minute,”
said Miss Joe, hurrying out, and hastening into the front
hall, where Cæsar was lighting the lamp.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Cæsar, come here to me, quick—close. Hush! don’t
say anything. Go as hard as you can to Hemlock Hollow,
and tell Mr. Lionel Hardcastle how he must come
as fast as possible here; how he’s wanted badly, very
badly. Hurry—mount a fast horse, and go as quick as
ever you can!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man, with his eyes staring wide, ran to obey. Miss
Joe then returned to the parlor, where she found Garnet
giving directions to a servant to have two horses saddled,
and prepare himself to attend her down to the
shore. Miss Seabright was giving her orders with so
much calmness and precision that the old lady thought
she had a lucid interval in her madness, and that this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>afforded her an excellent opportunity for argument; so,
as soon as the man retired, she said coaxingly:</p>

<p class='c010'>“My dear child, think of it!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do, Miss Joe; and the more I think of it the more
I want to go. I am determined to vary the tedious
monotony of my days with a little adventure!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My dear child, you have heard of the fate of Agnes!
How she was either murdered or carried off from that
island by unknown ruffians!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I heard long ago of her mysterious disappearance,
Miss Joe, and I always thought, and think now, that in
her deep despair for the sudden loss of her husband she
drowned herself. I think so the more that never before
or since that strange occurrence, has any outrage been
attempted on the island. Think of the years we lived
there alone with nothing to disturb our quiet. Why,
often in the fond superstition of my childhood, when
I have waked up in the night, have I risen and gone out
into the starlight, and rambled all over the isle in the
hope of surprising the fairies at their midnight revels!
Well, if I never found them, I never found anything
worse. No, Miss Joe, there is no danger. If there were,
I do not know the fear of it. That solitary light on the
isle belongs to some solitary wretch, poorer and more
friendless even than we were; one whose misfortunes or
crimes make him dread and shun the approach of his
fellow-men; one whom I do not fear to seek; one whom,
if I find, I shall try to relieve. And I will tell you, if
that will ease your kind anxiety upon my account, I will
direct Pompey to take a pair of pistols.”</p>

<p class='c010'>As she finished speaking a servant appeared at the
door, and announced that the horses were ready.</p>

<p class='c010'>She left the parlor, and soon returned prepared for
her ride, and immediately set out.</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Joe fidgeted up and down the hall in great disturbance
of mind. In about ten minutes after Miss Seabright
had left the house the quick trampling of horses
announced the arrival of Lionel Hardcastle. He hurried
into the house, booted and spurred as he was, and
asked rapidly:</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>“Where is Miss Seabright? Has she sent for me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, sir; no. It was me that sent for you. Come
here—here in the parlor, sir. I have got something
terrible to tell you. Shut the door.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He followed her into the parlor, closing the door as
requested, and stared with astonishment at the old lady’s
excited countenance, while with rapid enunciation she
related all that had happened just before and since his
visit in the forenoon. Miss Seabright’s excited manner,
her mad resolution of going that night to Hutton’s Island
to find out about the light, and above all her “real
crazy” talking about committing a sin before the world
in order “to keep in long o’ the world.” Mr. Hardcastle
listened with a sarcastic smile until he heard of
her night expedition; then his sinister face lighted up
with demoniac joy, to conceal which he quickly averted
his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ha! with only one attendant, say you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“With no one, sir, but Pomp—sure as you’re born.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I must instantly go after her then.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, do, sir! do hurry!” said Miss Joe, and in five
minutes more Lionel Hardcastle, with the dark and
lowering brow of a fiend hidden by the night, was galloping
swiftly toward the coast, muttering in his heart:
“Now, scornful girl, shall my love and vengeance both
be sated!”</p>

<p class='c010'>In the meantime Garnet had reached the shore at
which the Mount Calm fleet of boats were chained—boats
of all sizes, from the long skiff to the twelve-oared
canoe and the sail-boat. She entered the smallest of the
skiffs, followed by Pompey, who immediately unlocked
the chain, took the single oar, and pushed off from the
sandy beach. The bay was perfectly smooth, and reflected
the dark, resplendent sky, with its myriads beyond
myriads of shining lights so distinctly that the
little skiff seemed to glide among the stars as it sped
over the waters. Soon before then lay Hutton’s Island,
like a darker line upon the sea. And there, like a single
star, shone the solitary light! Yet so much deeper was
Garnet’s love of nature than of adventure, that she delivered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>herself up to intense enjoyment of the starlight
night on the waters, forgetful of her errand, until the
slight shock of the skiff, touching upon the strand of
the island, aroused her from her trance. Then, when
she looked up, the light on the isle was gone.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is very provoking! Now who would have
thought that darkly and silently as we came we should
have been perceived? However, light your pine knot,
Pompey, and come along.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Pompey had been selected as her attendant in this expedition
by Miss Seabright, as being the least superstitious
and cowardly of all her men, yet now the namesake
of “The Invincible” shrank back in dread, muttering:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Indeed, indeed, miss, you’d better not!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Pompey! whoever the dweller on this isle is, it is
some poor wretch, more worthy of our pity than of our
fear; weak and timid, since it watches and hides from
even such harmless visitors as we. Come along!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“’Deed—’deed, miss, that aint good reasonin’! ’Deed,
’fore my Heavenly Marster, aint, miss. ’Deed—’deed—’deed—’deed——”
muttered Pompey, his teeth chattering,
until he lost his voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Give me the torch then, Pompey; I will go before.
You may follow me as distantly as you please, and run
at the first alarm!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think that would be the mos’ safes’, miss; caze dey
wouldn’t be so apt to shoot a young lady, miss, as they
would to shoot a colored gemman ob my siteration in
deciety.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Without hearing Pompey’s compromise with his cowardice
and his conscience, Miss Seabright, torch in hand,
walked up the gradually ascending rise of ground to the
ruins of the old lodge. From being so long out in the
night her eyes had become accustomed to it, so that now,
under the brilliant starlight, the scene was distinctly,
though darkly, before her—the ruin, the isle, and the sea.
No sign of fence or outhouse could be seen as she approached
the ruined lodge, whose skeleton walls stood
up square around what seemed a deep, stagnant pond,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>whose stillness was drearily broken by the plunge of some
toad, snake, or other loathsome reptile. Blinded or
scared by the glare of the torch, bats flitted to and fro
about the ruined walls, water rats ran in and out among
the broken stones, and plunged into the stagnant waters,
and lastly, a huge screech-owl took flight from the
blasted tree by the fallen chimney, “making night hideous”
with his yells. Profoundly saddened by seeing the
beloved home of her wild childhood so desolate, Garnet
turned silently away, and passing mournfully over the
bleak ground, reached the strand. Then passing slowly
all around the beach, she looked out upon the waters in
search of any stray boat that might contain the supposed
fugitive of the isle. As far as the eye could reach
no sign of a boat could be seen. She then turned inland—if
the tiny isle could be said to have an inland—and
searched carefully about, walking around every specterlike
tree standing far apart on the bare, bleak island, and
quite incapable after all of concealing the smallest possible
fugitive in the human shape. But she looked around
and up into them, as I have seen men look under candlesticks
and into tiny drawers for their missing hats, umbrellas,
and boot-jacks! After her thorough search was
quite over she turned to her attendant, and said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I am disappointed. There is positively no one
here, and the mystery of the island light is still unsolved.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Her attendant did not answer. Thinking that he was
still under the influence of fear, she said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, Pompey, we are as safe and as quiet here as I
was when I lived here with Aunt Joe and Hugh.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Still her follower did not speak, but rather lingered
behind her, and she herself relapsed into silence, and fell
into a reverie, until she arrived at the farthest extremity
of the isle, opposite to that on which she had landed.
This was the northwestern point of the island, and the
same beach upon which she and the sole companion of
her childhood, Hugh, used to pick maninosies. Here,
as she walked about watching the starlit waves break
gently on the beach, noting the numerous perforations,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>where the maninosies had buried themselves in the sand,
the tide of memory rolled back, overwhelming the apprehension
of the present. She saw herself, a tiny,
sprite-like child, stealing out on starlight nights, and
sitting on the pile of rocks, on this very spot, watching
in fond faith for the swimming of the nereids, and mistaking
the reflection of some purple cloud, high up in the
heavens, for the royal robe of Amphytrite in the “deep,
deep sea.” She saw herself again in the daytime, when
the setting sun, like Macbeth’s blood-crimsoned hand,
would</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The multitudinous seas incarnadine,</div>
      <div class='line'>Making the green one red!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>she saw herself well shod and warmly clothed, and Hugh,
the manly boy, barefooted, bareheaded, and coarsely
clad, yet grandly handsome “as Hercules ere his first
labor!” Hugh, with his noble look and noble nature;
and she smiled to think of the high faith, and hope, and
love that irradiated his fine countenance, as he confidently
promised to make a fortune for her, his sister; to
get wealth, rank, honor for her! And the tears rolled
down Garnet’s cheeks, as she thought of the glorious
boy, and thought how many, many years it had been
since she had even inquired his residence or his destiny.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He thought,” she said, speaking to herself in a low self-communing
voice, “he thought to have made a fortune
before me—to have conferred wealth, rank, honor
upon me! The case might be reversed—it might! oh!
I wish it could! There is only one way in which it
could, and that is not impossible, though remote. This
dream that I have enshrined within my heart—this ideal
of goodness and greatness with which only I will unite—this
I owe to Hugh. And oh! if he has fulfilled in his
manhood the glorious promise of his boyhood, whatever
his external fate may be, if he has fulfilled in himself the
promise of matured goodness and greatness—then——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What then?” said a deep voice at her elbow.</p>

<p class='c010'>She started slightly, and exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c010'>“My guardian!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>“Yes, Miss Seabright, your guardian; who never
found you more in need of his guardianship than at
present.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sir! why have you followed me here?—where is my
servant?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Having come upon him, cowering, several yards behind
you, I took the liberty of sending him back to the
mainland, by the boat in which you came!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Garnet’s eyes began to blaze and darken with fearful
rapidity. Yet repressing the mounting fire of anger, she
strove to ask calmly:</p>

<p class='c010'>“And why did you ‘take the liberty’ of sending my
servant away, sir? And why have you further presumed
to break upon my privacy?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“One question at a time, if you please, Miss Seabright.
I sent your servant away that I might have the pleasure
of a private interview. I break upon your solitude for
the furtherance of the same purpose.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And your object, sir?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To come to a full and final reckoning with you!”
he said, his manner suddenly becoming threatening.</p>

<p class='c010'>Garnet pressed both hands upon her bosom, to restrain
its violent throbbings, and answered slowly:</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought, sir, that our last interview, of only this
morning, had finally settled all between us? Upon that
occasion I told you some harsh truths—and with some
violence, which I regret; feeling sorry that the honest
verdict of my head and heart should not have been delivered
with more temperance.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And which you shall more deeply regret before we
part, scornful girl.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Her eyes blazed wide and full, like sudden meteors,
and then fell into darkness, as she replied, with constrained
calmness:</p>

<p class='c010'>“I pray you, sir, do not provoke me. I am subject
to anger, as other people are to ague and fever.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ha, ha, ha! Is that meant for an appeal or for a
threat? If for an appeal, I am not subject to magnanimity,
as other people are to insanity!—if for a threat,
how ridiculous! Be angry—furious—violent! What
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>can you do now? Why, thou foolish girl, thou art completely
in my power.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“In your power! Not so, insolent creature, ‘whom it
were base flattery to call a man’; there are no circumstances
whatever that could put me in your power.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, you absurd woman! look around you. Deep
and silent night hangs over the world. You stand alone
with me upon a barren, uninhabited, sea-girt isle. How
far off do you suppose the nearest human being is from
us? How loud a shriek from this lone spot could raise
the distant sleepers of the mainland from their beds?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Garnet raised her proud head to give some indignant
answer, but meeting the gaze of her companion, the
burning, scathing anger of her reply froze in horror ere
it passed her lips—for never did night lower over a countenance
darker, more dreadful with demoniacal malignity
of purpose. Garnet turned her eyes from the baleful
glare of Hardcastle to throw them over the lone and
desert isle on which they stood, and for the first time
a sense of the appalling danger of her situation swam
in upon her brain, and for a moment nearly overwhelmed
her. His countenance lighted up with a fiendish
triumph. He continued:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, Miss Seabright. Yes, Garnet. You have read
my look and purpose aright. This night must you and
I come to a reckoning. This hour, haughty girl, shall
your pride be humbled. To-day you rejected my hand
with scorn. To-morrow shall you sue for it as for life.
Ha! already my triumph begins. You grow pale,
lady.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No!—pale? If my cheek did so belie my soul as to
grow pale before a wretch like you, by my soul, I would
paint it black for the rest of my life, and sell myself to
base servitude as being too low for any other sphere.
Oh, sir! the sudden revelation of your enormous wickedness
shocked me for a single instant, as if I had unexpectedly
been confronted with the foul fiend—that was
all! And now I tell you that even on this lone sea isle
I do not feel myself to be in your power. I am not the
least afraid of you! Afraid of you? I am afraid of nothing.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>I do not know the word. I never did know it; and
it is not likely that you can teach it to me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“By Heaven, she defies me even here!” exclaimed
Hardcastle, pale with rage, and striding toward her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” said Garnet, recoiling a step or two, and standing
upon the fragment of rock where she had so often
sat in childhood; “yes,” she said, reverently raising her
eyes and hand, “by Heaven, I do defy you! Under the
protection of Heaven, in the name of Heaven, I do defy
you!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Thou fool! Why, what shall
hinder me now from refuting you and taking my revenge?”
he said, again striding toward her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Off! A parley, I say! Listen to me a moment.
God! myself! yourself shall hinder you. Mr. Hardcastle,
I have this hour conquered a greater and stronger adversary
than yourself—even mine own spirit! I have
overcome my anger; I have the lion of my temper
chained beneath my feet. And now, to put you down
will be a much lighter task—much easier victory. And I
tell you now, in coolness, what I told you before in heat,
that I am not afraid of you. Nor shall you falsely take
the tone toward me of one who has the advantage. I
know you, Mr. Hardcastle. And I know your present
evil scheme by your former revealed treachery. Heaven
purify my soul from the sin of the knowledge! I know
that you now think you have me at your mercy, and intend
to terrify me into making conditions with you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the fiend’s name, young woman, what do you
mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“This, to be explicit: You think to fright me, Garnet
Seabright, into the promise to become your wife, and
endow you with the broad lands of Mount Calm, upon
condition of your sparing me, showing mercy to me, and
taking me safely home to Mount Calm.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“By all the demons, girl! I wonder that you should
dare to give breath to that fear!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not fear!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To that suspicion, then. I am amazed that you
should venture to place these conditions before me.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>“That I should detect and pluck the villainous scheme
from your heart, and hold it up before you. Well, I will
go further in my defiance of you, Mr. Hardcastle, and
tell you that, threaten what you may, I will never, under
any circumstances, promise to be your wife. Now, you
see that I know I am not at your mercy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“By Satan, Miss Seabright, I am thunderstruck at
your audacity! Girl, you would be but a sparrow in my
grasp! Who could rescue you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thank you for the word you used in illustration
of my weakness. It recalls in good time the words of
a favorite old volume of mine—a book, perchance, with
which you have not chanced to meet. Listen! ‘Are not
two sparrows sold for a farthing? Verily, I say unto you,
not one of these shall fall to the ground without your
Father. Are ye not of more value than many sparrows?’
Heaven pardon me! I should not have quoted Scripture
here, Mr. Hardcastle. Nevertheless, it helps to make me
fearless now. Sir, I will tell you once for all why I do
not fear you. First, because I trust in God. Next, because
I trust in myself. Finally, because I can somewhat
trust in you! Cut off as we now are from all communion
with our fellow-creatures—alone, defenseless, unprotected,
and at your mercy as I seem—you dare not harm
me, and I know and feel it! You are not mad or intoxicated;
therefore, you will not. You are not of a passionate,
impetuous nature, therefore you will not. You are
a cold-blooded, clear-headed, calculating, forecasting
schemer—therefore you will not dare to do me an
injury that will end in ruin to yourself. You are a gentleman
by birth, education, and position. You are a gentleman—however
undeserving of the name—and you will
not exchange the title for that of—felon! I am under
the protection of God and of the laws! Lay but your
hand in insult on me, and by the Heaven that watches
over us, as soon as I reach the mainland, cost what it may
to my woman’s heart, for the sake of sacred right will
I denounce you! Murder me—sink my body in the sea!—the
crime would still be traced to yourself. We were
known to have been left here alone.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>“Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! We were
known to be left here alone together! Ha, ha, ha, ha,
ha! By none but the negro, and a negro’s evidence is
not received in any court of law! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!”
he laughed, in fiendish triumph. “I have allowed you
to spring from my hands, and I have listened to your
talking, only to make game of you. Only as a cat lets
a mouse run before finally seizing it. But this has lasted
long enough!” he exclaimed, ferociously springing toward
her, seizing and hurling her from the rock.</p>

<p class='c010'>Summoning all her great strength the intrepid girl,
with a mighty effort, threw him from her, and before
he could spring upon his prey again the fragment of
rock near them rolled down the slope to the beach—a
sudden light glared upon the scene, and a tall woman,
wildly clad, and waving a torch above her head,
emerged, and stood before them. The sudden irruption
of this human being from the bosom of the earth did not
astonish Garnet as did the look of Lionel Hardcastle.
Struck pale as death, and statue-still, but for the universal
tremor that shook his frame, he stood and gazed with
stony eyes and chattering teeth upon the apparition. At
last:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Agnes!” he gasped, shaking as with an ague fit.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, pirate!—Agnes!” said the woman, approaching
him slowly, holding the torch above her head; then
stooping, fixing her eyes intently upon him, and thus
creeping toward him, as a lioness preparing for a couch
and spring. She paused before him, and still glaring on
his face, said very slowly: “So, pirate! we meet again,
at last! We meet upon the spot of that outrage which
first separated me from home and country, friends and
kindred, holiness and heaven! We meet upon this spot
that you would again desecrate with crime! We meet
in an hour of retribution! For this have I lived! For
now that at last I see my mortal foe, never will I lose
sight of you again until I have put you in the hands of
justice! Never will I cease to pursue you, until I hunt
you to the scaffold! Never can I die, until I see you
dead before me by the death of a felon!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>While she spoke with such slow tones of settled hatred
and determined vengeance he held his hand in his bosom.
As she ceased speaking:</p>

<p class='c010'>“False prophetess! You die now!” he thundered,
leveling the pistol he held at her head.</p>

<p class='c010'>She sprang forward, seized his arm, turning the
weapon aside. They struggled violently for a moment,
and then the pistol was discharged, and Lionel Hardcastle
fell, shot through the chest.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frozen with horror Garnet Seabright drew near, and
stooped over the fallen man. Agnes also bent over her
prostrate foe for a moment, then turning to Garnet, and
throwing her wild hair back, she said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“I did not kill him, madam, though if I had ’twould
have been but just.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The eyes of the dying man flared open once, and fixed
upon the face of Garnet. Raising himself upon his elbow,
he said, in low and broken tones:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Forgive me, Garnet—and—believe this!—whatever
were the hidden sins of my youth—neither piracy nor
bloodshed were among them! I was a—prisoner among
them! Ship—wreck—plank—waves—picked up—oh,
God, forgive me!” His head fell back—he rolled over
in a mortal struggle, and then grew still in death.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Beehive” was the name that had been given by
Elsie to her first backwoods home, and afterward transferred
by her to the substantial home of hewn rock that
had replaced the log cabin.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>It is late in the afternoon of a blustering March day
that I shall again introduce you into the household of
Dr. Hardcastle. And it is a large and interesting family
for which the doctor is now responsible.</p>

<p class='c010'>First, there is himself, as glorious a type of manhood
as ever stood in the exposed outer circle of existence, interposing
his own body between the storms and cares of
life and the cowering forms of women and children.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then, there was his pupil, Hugh Hutton—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“As tall, as sinewy, and as strong</div>
      <div class='line in2'>As earth’s first kings—the Argo’s gallant sailors;</div>
      <div class='line'>Heroes in history, and gods in song,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>and bearing, in that genial dignity of form, countenance,
and manner which was the natural expression of great
conscious power and goodness, a general resemblance to
his master.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was Mrs. Garnet, in her simple widow’s dress
of black silk, with surplice bosom, inside handkerchief,
and little lace cap—somewhat jaded, yet with her graceful
form, fair complexion, delicate features, and pensive
thoughtfulness of expression, presenting a pleasing image
of the “intellectual system of beauty.” In charming
contrast to her was her daughter, Mrs. Hardcastle, in
the full bloom of perfectly developed vital beauty, revealing
that marriage and maternity had been to her
healthful, sanguine, and joyous organization, what they
should be to all women, a continuous accession of new
life, health, and happiness.</p>

<p class='c010'>She had made no mistake in the calculation of her future.
Active, bustling, often very laborious her lot had
been indeed, but suited to her strong and cheerful nature.
Her life had been guided, besides, by almost
unerring intelligence, sustained by undying love, and
cheered by unfailing hope. Anxieties had come, indeed,
but these had not been suffered to grow into corroding
cares. Sorrow had visited them, too, but this had not
been permitted to crush them with despair, or even bow
them long in despondency. In the second year of their
married life the Angel of Death had entered their dwelling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>and lifted their only child from its mother’s bosom.
Yes, the firstling of their little flock—the first-born of
their youthful love, the strong and beautiful child, so
full of glorious promise, whose health and life seemed
so secure, who was, besides, so watched and tended—that
idolized child was borne away from their arms, and
the hearts of the parents long writhed in the anguish
of bereavement before they could understand and receive
the divine message in the infant’s little life and
death. They had been so independent, so confiding, so
happy in their earthly lot, so absorbed in their worldly
plans, that they might never even have lifted their eyes
to Heaven but for gazing after the soaring wing of their
cherub; might never have lifted their hearts to Heaven,
but for yearning after the ascended and glorified child;
for “where the treasure is, there will the heart be also.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They had now been married eleven years, and six
other children claimed their love and care; six children—boys
and girls—with their ages ranging from one year
old to nine. They were not rich. They owned the
homestead, farm, and improvements upon the latter, but
beyond this they did not possess a thousand dollars. Dr.
Hardcastle’s practice was very extensive, and very
profitable to—his patients; not very enriching to himself.
With a large and growing family, with a strong and
sympathetic nature, generous heart, and open hand and
purse, how could Magnus Hardcastle grow rich? Indeed
he must have been much poorer than he was but
for the efficient aid of his “woman-kind.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Garnet had gradually assumed to herself the responsibility
of the needlework of the family.</p>

<p class='c010'>Elsie did all the housework.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hugh Hutton constituted himself hewer of wood and
drawer of water, stock-driver and feeder, gardener, assistant
nurse and tutor, doctor’s boy, big brother, and
helper-in-general to the establishment.</p>

<p class='c010'>And he found time, besides, for the systematic and assiduous
study of medicine, so that within the last year
he had been dubbed by the neighbors the young doctor
of the professional firm.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>For the last two years Hugh had spent the winters
in an Eastern city, attending lectures at the Medical College.
Upon these occasions he usually left home upon
the 1st of December and returned upon the 1st of March.
This was the last winter of his purposed migrations East,
and his friends at home were expecting his return with
unusual impatience. The 1st of March had come, however,
and he had not yet arrived. A letter from him had
informed his friends that he remained in the city for the
purpose of presenting himself before the medical board
of examination as a candidate for a diploma.</p>

<p class='c010'>The family were now in daily expectation either of his
arrival or of another letter. It was upon the evening of
the 7th of March, then, that the commodious family room
of the house was occupied by Mrs. Garnet and six children
of Elsie’s. This room was well warmed and lighted
by a large fire of pine logs in the chimney, and a couple
of lighted candles upon the mantelpiece. The supper-table
was set, and supper was ready to be served as soon
as the doctor should get in from his rounds. It had not
long to wait; for soon Dr. Hardcastle was seen to ride
into the yard, dismount, and take off his saddle-bags and
booted spurs, and, great coated as he was, came into
the house. As soon as he set foot within the room the
children swarmed upon him like bees upon a sunflower
stalk, or the Lilliputians upon Gulliver; and he lifted and
kissed them one by one, but looking around impatiently
the while for one he loved even more than all these little
ones—to wit, the mother. At last:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where is Elsie, Mrs. Garnet?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gone again; I do wish, Magnus, you would prevent
her. She makes herself a slave to these poor neighbors
of hers. I do really think that she has family cares and
toils enough; and that when she has performed her
household duties as well as she always does, she might
consider herself discharged from other social obligations.
I do wish you would talk to her very seriously about it.
Now to-day she has had a very fatiguing time indeed; she
was ironing all the forenoon, and this afternoon baking.
And yet this evening, as soon as she had got supper and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>set the table, she placed the children all in my care, and
against my advice, high as the wind is, and deep as the
snow is drifted, she took a basket and filled it with provisions,
and started to carry it to those poor Millers on
the mountain. Indeed, I wish, Magnus, you would tell
her not to do it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Me tell Elsie to do or not to do! Whew! Do you
know, my dear lady-mother, what is the highest, the
very highest boon of God to man? Free will—the
blessed liberty of going even to the old Nick if they
please. There are those so fond of ‘freedom,’ that they
would prefer going to perdition by the exercise of their
free will to being arbitrarily predestined to heaven!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps so; but Elsie is not one of those, Dr. Hardcastle.
If you were but to hint to your wife that you
disapprove and dislike her thus exposing herself, she
would stop it at once; she would think it her duty to
do so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know it; and therefore I have to be more chary in
meddling with her docile spirit than if she had the self-will
and temper of Xantippe. But, ah! do you think it
does not make my heart ache to see her expose herself
to wind and snow, and to think that I have not yet provided
a carriage for her, and to see her work from early
morning till night, doing all the housework of the family,
and think that I have not yet got a servant for her?
And now having brought her to all this, shall I fetter
her will? No, by my soul!” said Dr. Hardcastle, with
strong emotion.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Garnet arose and went to his side, and stood
there, and drew his arm over her shoulder caressingly,
as she said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Magnus, you have made Elsie completely, divinely
happy; I mean, as a mortal woman can be! No man
can do more for his wife, very few can do so much. As
for her privations and toils, it is I, only I, whose weakness
caused all that! It was I who disinherited her! I!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hush! hush! a truce to self-criminations! Elsie is
the only consistent, rational, equable one in the family,
now Hugh is gone. And here she comes, the darling!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>and without her cloak, as I live. Come, Mrs. Garnet,
we will both scold her for that. Let’s open upon her as
soon as she gets in.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He kissed Alice’s hand and hastened to meet his wife.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here she came, cold as the weather was, actually without
her cloak.</p>

<p class='c010'>He opened the door quickly, and received her in his
arms, pressing her cold hands under his chin, to his
bosom, to warm them, and drawing her on toward the
fire.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now where have you been, facing the wind, and
plunging through the snowdrifts?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have been on the mountain,” said Elsie, untying
her bonnet, and giving it to one child, and throwing
her shawl upon the arms of another. “I have been on
the mountain to see those poor Millers. Their little girl,
almost barefooted, came over here this afternoon for me
to go to her mother, who is confined. I knew they were
suffering, and so I filled the basket and went home with
the little one.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But your cloak, dear! What in the world have you
done with your cloak?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh! I laid it over Susan Miller and her babe, until
I could come home, and send them a blanket. Oh, now
don’t look so shocked! I am warmly clothed without
the cloak; besides, the distance was short, and I ran
along fast. Nonsense, now! How is it that children are
half their time out running and romping in the cold,
without being wrapped up, and only grow more robust
by the exposure?” said Elsie, laughing, as she arose,
pushed her curls back from her blooming face, and went
and lifted her crowing babe from the cradle.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then she sat down and nursed it, while Mrs. Garnet,
assisted by the eldest child, a little girl of nine years old,
began to arrange the supper upon the table.</p>

<p class='c010'>As Elsie sat and nursed the child, her blooming, joyous
face softened into sadness, tears gathered in her eyes,
and she sighed deeply, bowing her head over the babe.
Magnus was watching her. He was accustomed to her
occasional moods of sorrowful tenderness, which, he said,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>compared with her usual bright, cheerful temper as a
general, steaming thaw contrasts with a fine, clear, frosty
morning. He stooped over the back of her chair, and,
bending his head close to hers, asked:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of what are you thinking so sadly, Elsie?”</p>

<p class='c010'>A slight flush warmed her cheek, and she replied,
meekly, without raising her head:</p>

<p class='c010'>“An unworthy thought, dearest; at least, ungrateful
and presumptuous. I was thinking of that poor family,
of the little good that I was able to do them, and the great
pleasure it gave me to do even that. I will confess to
you all the egotism of my thought—then I thought how
generous I really was by nature, and how I should delight
in doing a great deal of good, if I had the means;
and then an emotion of discontent, and a disposition to
murmur, came upon me, and I thought what a pity it was
that I, so really liberal by nature, should be compelled
to repress so many generous impulses—that I should not
have a fortune to spend—and I sighed from self-pity. I
am ashamed that such ungrateful emotions should have
disturbed my heart, and I speak of them now with shame,
for now I feel how presumptuous they really were; for
why, indeed, should I have a fortune, or anything else
that we have not gained by our own toil? I, who am
already so happy in the wealth of family affections,
Magnus.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dear Elsie, if the material and temporal good of
mankind were first to be thought of, doubtless then it
were better that wealth should be in the hands of the
benevolent and philanthropic. But such is not the case.
It is the spiritual and eternal welfare both of the individual
and of the race that is provided for; and hence each
individual is placed in circumstances, not where he can
do the most seeming good, but where he can best develop
his moral and spiritual nature. Thus, you have
benevolence. You do not need to have that virtue cultivated
by the contrast of your own wealth with another’s
want, and by the exercise of almsgiving; hence, you are
not schooled in prosperity and the duty of beneficence.
But, Elsie, as you are not perfect, perhaps there are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>other virtues you lack, and which can be developed only
in poverty. But I did not mean to preach you a little
sermon, darling. And now, in requital of prosing, I will
tell you two pieces of good news—first, that as this is
the last year in which we shall be put to any expense
for Hugh’s college course of lectures, we shall have a
hundred or so dollars over our annual expenditures;
half of this sum you shall disburse in judicious alms.
That is my first piece of glad tidings, and my second is
like unto it—Hugh himself will be home to-night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hugh home to-night? Oh, you don’t say so!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; this afternoon, in post office, I got a letter that
arrived yesterday. And this letter announces the arrival
of Hugh this very evening.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hugh coming home this evening? Oh, I am so glad!
Children, children, did you hear? Brother Hugh is coming
home this evening.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Brother Hugh is come!” said a pleasant voice, as the
door opened, and Hugh Hutton stood among them.</p>

<p class='c010'>All arose, and Magnus and Elsie hastened to meet him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dear friends,” he said, shaking hands right and left,
“I could not resist the desire I felt to go to the window
and look in upon you while you were all at your quiet
evening occupations. I have been watching you for the
last two minutes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You rogue! But come to the fire, come to the fire.
Supper is just ready,” said Dr. Hardcastle, while Hugh
threw off his great-coat, and laid it aside with his hat.
“Oh, Hugh, we are so glad to see you! Had you a
pleasant journey? What time did you get to the village?
You have traveled day and night, I am afraid? And
then you have walked from the village here?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; I couldn’t have got a horse for two or three
hours; and I really couldn’t wait, I was so eager to get
home.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dear Hugh, you must be so tired and hungry!
Here, sit down in this chair near the fire,” said Elsie,
pushing a chair forward with one hand, while she held
the child with the other arm.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hugh threw himself into the chair, and mechanically
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>stretched out his arms and took the crowing, laughing
infant from its mother, and set it upon his knee, playing
with it all the time he talked to others.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, have you got your diploma, Hugh? Let’s see
the document with our own eyes,” said Dr. Hardcastle,
coming forward.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; here it is,” said Hugh, rooting in his pocket
with one hand, while he hugged the baby up with the
other. “Here it is. I took it out of my trunk to bring
along as a sort of credential that your years of kindness
have not been thrown away upon me, my best friend;”
and Hugh produced the parchment, and laid it on the
table.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good! good! Here it is, Elsie! Come, look! Here
is Dr. Hutton’s warrant to kill and cure, secundum
artem. Here is the diploma. Here is the prize for which
he has toiled so hard—the good of his race.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No; not the good, but the great starting place. Is it
not so, Hugh?” said Elsie, coming forward.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, true, the starting point. She is worthier than
I. The starting point, my boy. And now for a brilliant
career. Aim high, Hugh. He who aims at the sun may
not bring it down, but his arrow will fly highest. You
must be more successful than I have been, Hugh. I am
a useful—if you please—an extensively useful member
of my profession, and of society. You must be a distinguished
honor to the faculty and the world. Oh! I
have a grand ambition for you, Hugh, my son!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My dear friend! my best friend! all that I am and
have I owe to you, to your patient, disinterested teaching
of many years. Oh, yes! and all that I may become
or may possess I shall still owe to you! Ah, Dr. Hardcastle!
I speak of a debt! I shall never be able to pay
the debt I owe to you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, Hugh!” replied Dr. Hardcastle, throwing his
arm affectionately over the shoulder of his young friend,
and speaking in a voice as harmonious and gentle as a
woman’s. “Why, Hugh! never let me hear another word
of owing anything but brotherly love to me. You who
have been my second self in all my labors and professional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>cares; a son to me, except that you have given
me no anxiety, but much ease. My brother, companion,
confidant! Why, whatever could I have done without
you, Hugh? What could any of us have done without
you? Mrs. Garnet! how could you have got along without
your son, Hugh? Elsie! how could you have managed
to conduct your domestic and business affairs without
Hugh? Children! little ones, I say! what would you
take for ‘big brother’?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The last-named little shareholders in the Hugh Hutton
property swarmed around him, some with gentle, some
with vociferous demonstrations of affection. And their
mother laid her hands affectionately on his shoulders,
and, looking up in his face, said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dear Hugh! No! no one could possibly have supplied
your place to us, since we have known you. You
have been, indeed, like a younger brother, or an elder
son of the family, only that, as the doctor says, instead
of giving us trouble, you have relieved us of it. Oh,
Hugh! our dear boy! only be half as eminent as we hope
you will be, and we shall be so proud and happy in your
success!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come, come, Elsie, a truce to sentiment! Supper
waits, and a man who has staged night and day for a
week, and walked three miles to-night, must have a good
appetite for his supper, and a strong disposition to his
bed. Come; give the babe to his sister, there, and draw
your chair up. The children have been suffered to sit
up in honor of your arrival, Hugh. They are usually in
bed at this hour. Come,” said Dr. Hardcastle, seating
himself at the table, when all the others were seated,
“let’s see! What have we here to tempt a traveler’s appetite?
Mocha coffee—some of that which you sent us
by the wagon, Hugh—and cream and butter, such as
Elsie only can make. Here are some buckwheat cakes;
just try one. Our buckwheat has surpassed itself this
year. There, I don’t think you ever met with buckwheat
cake like that in the city. Indeed, I don’t think people
east of the mountains know what good buckwheat really
is. Take honey with your cake. There’s honey for you.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>The comb clear and clean like amber and frost. Our
bees have distinguished themselves this season. There
are venison steaks before you. Use the currant jelly
with them, Hugh, it is better than the grape. That is
the finest venison that I have seen this winter. Ah,
Hugh, you should have been with me when I brought
that stag down—shot him on the Bushy Ridge. Great
fellow!—eight antlers—five inches of fat in the brisket!—weighing—how
much did he weigh, Elsie? No matter.
You are laughing, Hugh. What at, sir, pray?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“At you, and myself, and stag-hunting, and deerstalking,
and story-tellings. The truth is, I never hear
of stags and antlers, but I think of a fine, bragging tale
I was cut short in while telling to my fellow-students at
a little farewell supper given by them to me when I was
coming away. I was trying to persuade some of them
to come out here, and boasting of the country. I was
launched into the midst of a grandiloquent eulogium.
‘Glorious country, sir!’ said I, ‘glorious country! sublime
mountains, piercing the clouds! mag-nif-i-cent forests
stretching five hundred miles westward! splendid
trees, sir, standing but two feet apart, their trunks measuring
three yards in circumference! their luxurious
branches inextricably intertwined! and game, sir! superb
deer, with antlers six feet apart, bounding through those
forests——’ ‘Where the trees grow but two feet apart,
and their branches are inextricably entwined, how the
very deuce do they manage to get through them, Hutton?’
asked my friend, bringing my magniloquence to a
sudden stand. I never was so disconcerted in my life. I
knew I had been telling the truth, yet had made it sound
like a fiction. At last I answered, ‘By Dian, sir, that is
their business, not mine, nor yours!’”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ha, ha, ha! Yes, pretty good! Yet, Hugh, you are
not romancing. There are parts of the forest where the
great trees grow in such thickets as you have described;
but they are as impassable to the deer as to us, of course;
and then there is superb game in the forest, which may
never approach within miles of such thickets. Take another
cup of coffee?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>“No, no, not any more,” said Hugh, pushing up his
plate and cup.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Hardcastle gave the signal, and they arose from
the table. The children had also finished their milk and
bread, and their mother took them upstairs to be put to
bed, while Mrs. Garnet washed up the tea things and
Dr. Hardcastle replenished the fire.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the table was cleared away, and Elsie had returned,
and they were all gathered around the evening
fireside, deeply engaged in telling and in hearing all that
had happened to each during the winter’s separation,
Hugh suddenly clapped his hand to his pocket, with a
“Lord bless my soul!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, was ever such absence of mind!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Never in the world, of course. Only what’s it
about?” laughed Dr. Hardcastle.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, a letter—a letter that came in the same stage
with myself—a letter from Huttontown, for you. I took
it out of the office, and—indeed, I hope I have not lost
it,” continued Hugh, fumbling first in one pocket and
then in another. “Oh, here it is,” he exclaimed, producing
the letter, and handing it to the doctor.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The superscription is in a strange hand, to begin
with—a lady’s hand. Whom can it be from?” said Dr.
Hardcastle, breaking the seal. “Dated ‘Mount Calm.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mount Calm!” exclaimed all three of his hearers, in
a breath.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, dated ‘Mount Calm,’ and signed ‘Garnet Seabright.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Garnet Seabright?” exclaimed Mrs. Garnet, in a tone
of surprise and displeasure.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My little sister Nettie,” said Hugh, bending forward
with interest.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Can you read it aloud, doctor?” inquired Elsie, in a
low voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, dear,” replied Dr. Hardcastle, stooping to pick
up a second letter, that had fallen out of the first, and
retaining the one in his hand while he read the other,
as follows:</p>

<p class='c016'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>: Will you do me the favor of transmitting
the inclosed letter to Dr. Hugh Hutton, of whose address
I am entirely ignorant? Pray, pardon me for urging
your prompt attention to my request, as its subject
is of the utmost importance to Dr. Hutton, and requires
his instant action.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Very respectfully,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Here, Hugh, after all, the matter concerned only
you. Here is your letter,” said Dr. Hardcastle, handing
over the inclosed epistle to Hugh, who took it with a
look of amazed interest, tore it open, and read it in silence.
Suddenly he sprung up, overturning the chair,
and dropping the letter, as he exclaimed vehemently:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your horse! Your horse, doctor! Can I have your
horse to-night?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘A horse! A horse! my kingdom for a horse!’
Why, what the deuce is the matter now? Who’s killed?
Who’s wounded?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, doctor, no jesting. This is serious—this is terrible.
Only—quick!—can I have your horse?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Certainly, certainly, Hugh. But tell me, in one
word, what’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My mother, my long-lost mother, is found, and at
Mount Calm, but ill and dying, I fear. There! read
Nettie’s letter, while I saddle the horse. I must ride at
once to the village—the mail stage starts from there at
ten o’clock. I must go in it,” said Hugh, hastening
out.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Garnet and Elsie gathered around Dr. Hardcastle,
while he read the following letter:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c015'>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>There are other things, too, dear Hugh, of which I cannot
write now, but of which you will hear when you

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Strange! most strange!” said Mrs. Garnet.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And most unsatisfactory,” observed Elsie.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We shall know no more, however, until Hugh writes
us from Mount Calm. Here he comes! How quick he
has been!” said the doctor, going to meet Hugh as he
entered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You know, Hugh, how much I feel with you about
this. Let me know now if in any way I can be of service
to you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, my friend, I know all your goodness. But do
you know how much my secret heart has ever been filled
with the desire of finding my mother? I could never
hope to find her, but still, from my boyhood, the thought
of seeing her has haunted me like the dream of an impossible
good; and now she is found, but——”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hugh’s voice broke down, and he covered his face with
his hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hope for the best, Hugh. You used to be hopeful.
And, oh, Hugh, be sure that we feel your trouble as if it
were our own. It is our own,” said Elsie, laying her
hand gently upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My horse is ready. I only run in to say good-by;
good-by, dear friends. Good-by, Mrs. Garnet—pray that
I may not be too late! Good-by, Mrs. Hardcastle—give
my love to the dear children when they ask for me to-morrow.
Good-by, Dr. Hardcastle, my best friend. I
will write to you from Mount Calm,” said Hugh, shaking
and squeezing hands right and left, and then preparing
to hasten out.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Aint you going to take your great-coat?” asked the
doctor, holding it up.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, yes; I had forgotten it. I haven’t time to put it
on. I can throw it upon the horse,” exclaimed Hugh,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>hurriedly throwing the garment over his arm. “Once
more, good-by to all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If I had a second horse, or had time to borrow one,
I would go with you, Hugh,” said Dr. Hardcastle, attending
him from the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>The full moon was shining broadly and brightly over
the snow-clad hills and plains around Mount Calm, when
Hugh Hutton rode up to the front entrance of the mansion
in a full gallop. He threw himself from his horse,
flung the reins to a servant in attendance, ran up the
marble stairs, and, without stopping to ring, pushed at
once into the house.</p>

<p class='c010'>A large hanging-lamp lighted up the hall, and its rays
fell upon the form of a majestic and beautiful girl, whose
presence immediately arrested the impetuous hurry of
the visitor. Pausing, he bowed with deference, saying:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Miss Seabright?”</p>

<p class='c010'>He had always thought of her as Nettie; until he saw
her he purposed to have called her Nettie; but this was
not to be thought of now, in the presence of this imperial-looking
girl, with whom he would no more have
ventured upon familiarity than he would have dared to
make free with an empress. She, too, had thought of
her childhood’s companion as plain Hugh, had addressed
him as dear Hugh in her letter; but now, when she saw
before her this stately and reserved man, she blushed to
think of it. And when, with deferential suavity, he repeated
his question:</p>

<p class='c010'>“I presume—Miss Seabright?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>She answered: “Yes, Dr. Hutton;” and added, with
mournful gentleness, “Under happier circumstances I
should say that I am very glad to see you, sir; but now
I can only tell you truly that you are very, very welcome
to Mount Calm.” And she offered him her hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My mother? Miss Seabright! How is my mother?”
he inquired, alarmed at the sorrowful manner of his
young hostess.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come into the parlor, Dr. Hutton; there is a fire
there, and you are chilled,” said Garnet, sadly evading
the question, and leading the way.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My mother?” again inquired the guest, when she had
conducted him into the drawing room.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sit down, pray, sit down; you look so weary—here,
near the fire,” said his hostess, drawing a chair to the
hearth. He dropped into the seat—his prophetic heart
already prepared for the words she was about to utter.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your mother, Dr. Hutton, is above all pain and grief
now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dead! dead!” exclaimed Hugh, dropping his head
upon his open hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>Garnet bent over the side of his chair, and laid her
hand gently on his shoulder, and bowed her head until
tears fell upon his hands, but said nothing.</p>

<p class='c010'>At last: “How long since?” he asked, raising his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>She seated herself by his side, and with her hand gently
laid upon his, she replied:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your mother was ill but three days, Dr. Hutton.
Upon the first day I wrote to you—upon the third she
passed away. It is four days since, so that, you see, you
could not have reached here, even by the utmost speed;
and so you have nothing to blame yourself for.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dead! really dead! dead four days!” he exclaimed,
burying his face in his hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, not dead—living in heaven! You know that—try
to feel it also,” she said tenderly.</p>

<p class='c010'>He did not reply, nor did he speak again for some
time, nor did she break upon the sacred silence of his
grief by any ill-judged attempt at consolation.</p>

<p class='c010'>At last he broke forth in bitter lamentation.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>“Oh, that she had but lived! Oh, that my poor
mother had but lived! That her son might have atoned
in the last half of her life for the sorrows of her youth!
Oh, that my mother had but lived!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah! do not mourn so; believe me, it is far better as
it is. There are some lives so wronged, so broken, that
nothing but death can set them right. Such a life was
hers. There are some sorrows so deep that nothing but
heaven can cure them. Such sorrows were hers. Oh!
believe me, by all the loving-kindness of the Father, it is
better as it is,” said Garnet, kindly pressing the hand
she held.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If I could have seen her but once! Oh, Miss Seabright!
I thought but little about her in my boyhood,
but as I grew to man’s estate the one secret, cherished
hope of my heart was to find my mother—to devote my
life to her. Oh, that I could have found her; oh, that I
could have reached here in time to have seen her living
face but once, so as to have known and remembered it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Again I say it is better as it is. The tender mercy of
God spared you the trial. Would you have carried away
in your heart the picture of a countenance transiently
distorted by delirium, as the only impression of your
mother’s face? Oh, no! Think of her only as she has
been described to you in her youthful beauty, or think
of her as she is now, in her immortal beauty. She has
always been shrined in your heart as a beautiful and
sacred memory and hope. Let it be so still, and let the
hope be immortal.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She ceased speaking, and both relapsed into silence,
that lasted until the door opened and a servant entered,
bringing coffee and other refreshments upon a waiter.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wheel the table forward here, and set the waiter
upon it, and then you may go, Pompey,” said Miss Seabright,
in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>When they were alone together again Miss Seabright
poured out a cup of coffee, and offered it to her guest.
He thanked her, but declined it, and dropped his head
again upon his hands, and fell into silence and despondency.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>Miss Seabright put the cup of coffee down and came
and sat by his side, and laid her hand upon him again,
and said softly:</p>

<p class='c010'>“I feel how you suffer, Dr. Hutton; and I can imagine
that when we have lost a dear friend or dear relative,
especially a parent, we should think it almost a sin to take
comfort in any way, and selfishness even to refresh the
wasted, wearied frame with needful food and sleep. It is
so natural to feel so. Fasting and vigil are first compelled
by anxiety and grief, and afterward, when all is
over, and when nature has reasserted her claims, and
made us feel the need of food and rest—still often the
heart’s fond superstition will not yield, and fasting and
vigil are offered as a tribute to the memory of the lost.
It is so natural—but so wrong, Dr. Hutton—the rent
garments, and the torn hair, and the ashes sprinkled on
the head, and the inordinate worship of grief, belong to
pagan bereavement, which is ‘without hope, and without
God’—not to Christian sorrow, which should be calmed
by resignation and cheered by faith. My friend, you
are very weary and depressed—you need refreshment.
Come, Hugh, lift up your head; take this coffee from my
hand—Nettie’s hand.”</p>

<p class='c010'>As she stooped over him, offering the cup, the ends of
her soft ringlets touched his brow, and her breath fanned
his cheek. He raised his head, received the refreshment,
and gratefully pressed the gentle hand that gave it.
When he had drained the cup and set it down, he said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Miss Seabright, how much I thank you for your sympathy
and kindness none can know but God. Dear and
gentle comforter, tell me, now, the facts of this sad discovery.
When did my mother return, and under what
circumstances?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Had you not better defer hearing the story for the
present, Dr. Hutton? You look so tired. Retire early,
and sleep well to-night, and to-morrow morning I will
tell you everything you desire to know.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Miss Seabright, I have not slept since I received your
letter telling me of my mother’s advent and illness. I
shall never be able to sleep until I have heard all you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>have to tell me of that mother’s history and sorrows.
But, Miss Seabright, I beg your pardon—you are so
good, that your very goodness has made me selfish, and
forgetful of the trouble I may give you. You are doubtless
fatigued, and should not be longer harassed by the
presence of an exacting egotist like me. If so, let me
bid you good-night,” said Dr. Hutton, rising.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, no; sit down; besides, I cannot let you go to-night.
You are to remain with us, certainly, to-night—and
as many more days and nights as your convenience
will permit. Sit down; I am not the least wearied, and
if, indeed, you think you will rest better after having
heard the story I have to tell you, why, of course, I will
willingly tell it. Yes, and upon second thought, I feel
that it is better you should hear it to-night. To-night
let the grave close in faith over the sad past. To-morrow
you will arise with new hope for the future.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They both resumed their seats. And Miss Seabright
related to him the story of the nightly light seen on Hutton’s
Isle; her visit there, to ascertain the cause; her
guardian’s unexpected arrival; the sudden apparition of
Agnes; the encounter and the death of Lionel Hardcastle
by the accidental discharge of the pistol. Having
reached this point of her story, she went on to say:</p>

<p class='c010'>“At the first appearance of your mother I saw by
her wild look and frenzied manner that reason had fled.
But instantly after the fall of Lionel Hardcastle the sudden
change, the quiet manner with which she exculpated
herself from the suspicion of blood-guiltiness deceived
me so that I mistook for sanity that mood which was
only the reaction of frenzy—or, at best, a lucid interval
of madness. As soon as I had ascertained the victim to
be quite dead, and had collected my thoughts for action,
I determined to return to the mainland and rouse the
magistrate, Judge Wylie. The unhappy woman was sitting
upon the ground, with her head bowed upon her
hands, and her wild hair streaming all around her, like
a veil. I spoke to her, and told her my purpose, and
asked her to accompany me. She gave me no reply. I
spent a long time in trying to persuade her to get up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>and go with me—but I could not get a word or gesture
from her. I made no more impression on her than if she
had been a statue. Finally I was obliged to leave her
for the purpose of procuring assistance. I went down to
the beach, got into the skiff, took the paddle, and rowed
swiftly to the landing at Point Pleasant. I found all the
family there still up, owing to the decease of old Mrs.
Wylie, who had just expired. Judge Wylie, with his
usual promptitude, gave me all the help that was needful.
I returned with the party to Hutton Isle, where we
found the unfortunate woman in the same posture in
which we had left her. I spoke to her again, and with
no more success than before. Finding it impossible to
make any impression upon her, I requested Mr. Ulysses
Roebuck, who had command of the party, to lift her up
gently and convey her to the boat. He attempted to do
so, but on being raised she broke into sudden frenzy.
Dr. Hutton, spare me and yourself the details of this illness—it
is over now. It is sufficient to say that she was
brought hither, that she had the best medical attendance
and the best nursing that could be procured. She recovered
her reason about an hour before her death, and
asked to see a clergyman. Mr. Wilson, the Methodist
preacher, attended her. Of the circumstances of her
forcible abduction, and the misfortunes that ensued to
her, she refused to make any revelations, saying that the
dying should not drop a fire-brand into the circle they
were leaving. When told that she had a son, she blessed
you, and left this message for you, that ‘Forgiveness is
the only remedy for some wrongs’; and of herself she
said that ‘Death was the only rectifier of some lives.’
She died at set of sun—calmly and hopefully. At some
future day I will show you where they have laid her. As
for the unhappy man who met his death so suddenly—the
coroner’s jury sat upon his case before his remains
were permitted to be removed from the Isle. The body
was then conveyed to Hemlock Hollow for burial. Old
Mr. Hardcastle has not been able to leave his bed since
the shock of his son’s sudden death threw him upon it.
It is supposed that he cannot recover.” This Miss Seabright
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>added with the purpose of partially diverting the
mind of her guest from dwelling too intently upon the
circumstances of his mother’s death.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the close of her recital Dr. Hutton remained silent
for a few minutes, and then, taking and pressing her
hand, he thanked her, with much emotion, for the care
she had bestowed upon his mother.</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Seabright rang for night-lamps, and when they
were brought directed the servant to attend Dr. Hutton’s
leisure, and when he felt inclined to retire to show
him to his chamber. Then bidding her guest good-night,
she left the room.</p>

<p class='c010'>The next morning Dr. Hutton came down very early
and found Miss Seabright already in the drawing room.
She advanced to meet him, holding out her hand. After
the usual courteous inquiries about health, etc., Dr. Hutton
said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Miss Seabright, I scarcely know how to pardon myself
for my forgetfulness of an aged and worthy relative
last evening; but pray tell me now, how is my old aunt?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Miss Joe! oh, very well, indeed. The only mark of
infirmity I can perceive in her is her wish to go to bed
earlier now than heretofore. She had retired before you
arrived last night, and I would not have her disturbed.
She is in the breakfast room superintending breakfast.
She knows that you are here, but does not know that you
have risen. Shall I send for her?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you please, Miss Seabright. I have not seen my
aunt for two years. I have generally made it a point to
come and see her every year or two since I first left her,
and should have visited her this spring even, had not
your letter summoned me now. Ah! here she comes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Joe came in smiling and weeping, and drying
her eyes, and wiping her spectacles with her check
apron, and as soon as she saw her nephew she ran to
him and fell in his arms, laughing and crying and talking
all at once, and not regaining self-possession until she
became alarmed for the propriety of her cap and kerchief,
when she extricated herself, smoothing down her
apron and exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>“There, Hugh! There, Neffy! You’re not a baby
now; don’t tumble my cap and my handkerchief—there’s
no sense in it;” though, dear old soul, the fault lay all the
while in her own fondling—not Hugh’s. “There, come
to breakfast now. It is all on the table waiting, and will
get cold.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Dr. Hutton offered his arm to Miss Seabright, and
they went in to breakfast.</p>

<p class='c010'>After the meal was over Dr. Hutton made a motion
to depart, but Miss Joe vigorously opposed his purpose,
supplicating him to remain at Mount Calm for only a few
days, if not longer. Miss Seabright joined her invitation
to the old lady’s entreaties, and Dr. Hutton finally consented
to stay, and retired to his room to write letters to
his friends in the West.</p>

<p class='c010'>The few days of Dr. Hutton’s projected stay at Mount
Calm grew into a week, and the week was stretching into
a month, and still Hugh Hutton found it daily more difficult
to tear himself away from Garnet Seabright, for
every time he would make an attempt to go she would
say:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not yet, Dr. Hutton. Not just yet! Stay till to-morrow;”
and she would think, “Why does he not
speak? He loves me! He stays here at my bidding. He
must know that I love him, too! Why does he not
speak? Will he go away without an explanation? Can
it be that my fortune and his own lack of wealth hinders
him? There are some men so proud that they will not
marry an heiress, lest it be said of them that they owe
all they have to their wives. But such a thought would
never enter the head of my noble Hugh! He would not
elevate money on one side or the other into importance
enough to divide two hearts that love. Yet there is
some reason, and some good reason, why, when his eyes
and tones and gestures tell me every hour that he loves
and esteems me, his words never do.” And then sometimes
when alone she would break forth impatiently,
thus: “Indeed, I won’t bear this much longer! No,
that I won’t! I shan’t have Hugh’s heart and my own
tormented in this way to no good purpose! I will make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>him tell me what it all means! Feeling very sure he
loves me he shall tell me what all this hesitation
means.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Such would be her impatient resolve, but Garnet never
could bring herself to lead her lover on to any explanation,
until one night when Hugh for the dozenth time
made known that he should leave Mount Calm the next
morning. It was after supper when Miss Joe retired,
and they were playing a game of backgammon together.
Miss Seabright looked up from her dice and said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, Dr. Hutton, since you are going to-morrow,
and I feel that we cannot justly keep you from your business
any longer, I wish, before you depart, to ask your
advice—I——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, Miss Seabright?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I—you know that my social position is a very singular
one.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is, indeed, Miss Seabright.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Responsible as I am for the faithful stewardship of
a very large fortune——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is indeed, in your case especially, a very heavy
responsibility.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; and I have neither father nor brother to aid and
counsel me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My poor counsel is at your command always, Miss
Seabright.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you! It is in relation to the stewardship of
Heaven’s goods intrusted to me that I wish your advice.
One should not live for themselves alone, you know.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Assuredly not,” said Dr. Hutton, giving her his close
attention.</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Seabright then related at length certain very judicious
and extensive schemes of benevolence, and desired
his opinion upon them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your plans of usefulness and beneficence would be
both wise and good, reflecting honor on your head and
heart, but that they lack the proper foundation of all
schemes of action.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Justice.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>“Justice?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Justice!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not understand you in the least!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Miss Seabright, have you ever learned how it was
that you came into possession of all this estate?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My dear godfather gave it to me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you know why he conveyed it to you in his life
rather than bequeath it to you at his death?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Because, had he merely bequeathed it to you, his will
would have been set aside by our courts of justice in
favor of his wife and child.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, he did convey it to me! It is mine, at all
events!” said Garnet, with a flushed cheek and brow.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And yet he had a wife and daughter whom he beggared
to enrich you. Was this right?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Right! Yes, it was right! He cut off a fugitive wife
and a rebellious daughter! Right! Yes, it was right!
He did it, and he could have done no wrong! Therefore
it was right! Right! Yes, it was right! Who dares to
gainsay it?” she exclaimed, with her bosom heaving and
her color rising.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah! Miss Seabright, it is an ungracious task indeed
to unveil before you the true character and hidden motives
of your benefactor, of one whom you have always
looked upon with affection and respect——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Stop!” exclaimed Garnet breathlessly, and pressing
both hands upon her bosom, as was her custom when
trying to repress an eruption of anger. “Stop! If you
are about to breathe a syllable reflecting upon the memory
of my godfather—hold! I will not hear a breath,
believe me! A word that should wound his good name
would transfix my own heart.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“For your dear sake, Miss Seabright, I will respect
the name of General Garnet; but for the dearer sake
of justice I will plead the cause of his widow and
daughter.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of his widow and daughter! I am not—the Lord
knows it!—ungrateful, ungenerous, or cruel. I will
largely dower them both.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>“You will do no such thing, Miss Seabright! I trust
there is too much latent nobility in your character to
permit you to add such ‘insult’ to their ‘injury.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then what is it that you wish me to do?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What your conscience shall, after you understand the
matter, dictate to be done. He who gave you the Mount
Calm estate had no just right to do so. The whole of the
estate came by his wife, and should descend to her
daughter. It was held by her family, the Chesters, for
two hundred years.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I think two centuries quite long enough for
any one family to hold any one landed estate. I think it
quite time the property had passed into other hands,”
said Miss Seabright firmly. Then she added: “Besides,
my godfather must have had a legal right to the property,
else he could not have conveyed it to me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Miss Seabright, if you will permit me, for justice’s
sake, I will tell you the whole history of the transaction
by which General Garnet became legally possessed of the
Mount Calm estate. It is right—it is necessary that you
should know it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Say on, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Dr. Hutton began, and, softening as much as possible,
for her sake, the conduct of General Garnet, related the
atrocious history of his life and actions—first, how, aided
by her father, he sundered the engagement existing
between Alice Chester and Milton Sinclair and forcibly
married the heart-broken child; their wedded life of
tyranny on his side and suffrance on hers; the separation
of the mother and daughter; in after years his betrothal
of Elsie and Magnus; his subsequent attempt to break
their engagement from mercenary motives; his furious
anger at their marriage; the arts by which he gained from
his wife a deed of the Mount Calm estate; his revenge
in disinheriting his daughter; the taunts and cruelties by
which he had nearly caused the death of his wife, and had
finally driven her from him; and lastly, the legal acumen
with which, for the sake of more surely impoverishing
his wife and child, he had conveyed the estate, instead of
bequeathing it, knowing that the will, upon account of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>its crying injustice, would have been set aside by the
courts in favor of the widow and daughter.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There, Miss Seabright, that is the way in which your
godfather first, and you after him, came into possession
of the Mount Calm property.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Garnet Seabright had not listened patiently to this recital.
Many times her large, heavily-fringed eyes blazed
and darkened; her cheeks crimsoned and faded; and,
though she pressed both hands to her chest, her bosom
heaved and fell like the waves of the sea. Many times
she interrupted him, and nothing, perhaps, but the felt
law of justice enabled Dr. Hutton to persevere to the
close of his ungracious and unwelcome narrative.</p>

<p class='c010'>When he had closed by revealing the hypocrisy,
treachery, and revenge of General Garnet, all the color
was suddenly struck out from her face, as though she
had been blasted by a stroke of lightning, so white, so
still, and aghast was her aspect. Dr. Hutton hastened
to her side and took her hand. At the touch she rose in
trepidation, and, scarcely heeding what she said, exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not now! Not one single word now! I must be
alone, or die! To-morrow!—to-morrow I will hear
you!” and hurried, or rather reeled, from the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next morning she appeared at the breakfast table
with a face so pale and stern as almost to awe the good
Miss Joe from making an inquiry as to her health. And
when at last the old lady asked her if she were not well,
she replied curtly:</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>“An ill night’s rest!” and the questioning ceased.</p>

<p class='c010'>When she had retired to the drawing room Dr. Hutton
followed her thither. He found her standing on the rug
and resting her forehead against the mantelpiece. Her
long ringlets, hanging low, concealed her face from his
view, until she turned around and said, in a very low
voice:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dr. Hutton, you are not going away this morning,
are you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, Miss Seabright!—no, Garnet. I did not rouse
a war in your soul to leave you until peace should be
restored.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not know why you should say there is a war,”
said Garnet, in a deep voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can see it. That fiery blood that has left your brow
and cheeks and very lips of a gray paleness has mustered
somewhere. Besides, I know you, Garnet. You were
always very transparent to me. I know that in your soul
the powers of good and evil are drawn out in battle array
against each other.”</p>

<p class='c010'>With an adjuring gesture she left her position, and,
crossing the room, threw herself into a chair. He
watched her some few minutes where she sat, with her
pale brow resting on one hand and the other hanging
listlessly down, and then he slowly crossed the room, and,
dropping upon one knee by her side, raised her hand to
his bosom, and said, in a voice deep with passion:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Miss Seabright!—Nettie, my dear sister!—my wife,
if you will bless me so!—I wish—I do wish I had a kingdom
to offer you to replace this Mount Calm. As it is,
I have only myself, and an affection, an affection, Nettie,
that—oh, I cannot tell you in a few words, a few seconds,
that love which it will take all the years we live together
to express, to live out!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Hugh!” she said, in broken accents, “if you
knew where this rack screws and strains my heart-strings
most. To think that one whom I always loved and honored
with a passionate enthusiasm as the very first in human
excellence—but no more of that! Not my lips shall
breathe one word of blame, though all earth and heaven
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>cry shame on his memory!” said Garnet, as her dark eyes
smoldered and flashed and sank again, as she breathed,
in heart-broken tones: “No more of that! Oh, God, that
I could say to my thoughts, as to my tongue, ‘No more
of that’!”</p>

<p class='c010'>And, scarcely heeding her lover, she arose, threw back
her falling hair, pressed both hands upon her bosom, and
passed out of the room.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was late in the evening before he saw her again.
He went into the library after the lamps were lighted
and found her sitting at one of the reading tables, with
her head bowed down upon her folded hands. He went
and sat by her, saying:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Garnet, dearest, do not keep your thoughts and
troubles all to yourself; let me share them. Come,
come,” he continued, caressing her, “this is unkind! I
have had a very solitary day.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A solitary day! I wish you joy of it! Mine has been
‘peopled with the furies.’ Oh, Hugh, even in my wild
infancy I was such an ambitious child! Though, Heaven
knows, there was nothing around me to foster ambition,
unless it were the want of everything, and the study of
fairy tales! Oh, Hugh! if the little wild water-witch of
the isle was ambitious——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘The woman, gifted with beauty, talent, wealth, and
largest liberty, is a hundred times more so,’ you would
say,” said Hugh. “But, Garnet, do you know there is
an ambition more noble than all others—that of moral
greatness! Garnet, you have the opportunity granted
to few—the opportunity of moral heroism!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Hugh, before I saw you I had great schemes!
great schemes!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know it, dear Garnet; but they did not demand the
great moral force required of you to-day.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But since you came, Hugh——” Here her voice
broke down and she dropped her head upon the table for
a few minutes. Then, lifting it up again, she held her
veil of ringlets back, and said: “But since you came,
Hugh, all schemes have given place to one. I had been
living in such a golden dream, dear Hugh! Oh, listen!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>You know when we were two poor children, obliged to
pick our frugal meal of maninosies from the beach, and
I, inspired by the ‘Arabian Nights’ Entertainments,’
would be talking my wild, childish talk about sudden
riches and fairy grandmothers, you said you had a fairy
in your head who could convert the sand and clay into
gold-dust and precious gems.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I remember. It was when I dreamed of being
an agriculturist.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And you promised you would make a fortune for me;
confer rank, and wealth, and honor upon me?” she
asked, smiling very sadly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes—yes, Nettie!” he answered solemnly. “Yes,
and I hold myself bound to redeem that boyish pledge.
Doubly bound now, Nettie, for I must repay you for all
you lose.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, stop! Hear me out. Well—heigho! I thought
if Hugh could give Garnet a fortune he might also take
one from her—take one with her. Oh, Hugh! I knew
I could not confer upon you rank or honor; you must
make them for both of us; but I dreamed that I could
give you wealth to aid in doing it. Hugh, listen! I
heard you say that you would like to travel, and spend
some time in London, Paris, and at some of the German
cities, for the sake of perfecting your medical knowledge.
I then heard you regret that necessity which urged your
immediate settlement in some Western neighborhood, to
commence practice. Well, Hugh, I dreamed that necessity
would be obviated. I dreamed, Hugh, that we would
make a bridal tour to Europe, and sojourn in all these
capitals, while you pursued your studies at your ease.
Now my dream is over—over!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“God bless you for saying that, Garnet! God bless
you for saying that! The dream is over!—the dream is
over!—the battle is over, and your moral sense has nobly
conquered; you will yield up this property?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Over!—the battle? The doubt over! No! no! no!
no! I did not say that, either!” exclaimed Miss Seabright,
her whole aspect changing. Suddenly rising,
with flashing eyes and burning cheeks, and pacing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>room with rapid steps: “Over! No! man! man! Is it a
flower, a ring, an orange you ask me for, that I should
give it up without a struggle—as a matter of course?
Give up this estate! Why, I should be insane, frantic,
frenzied! Nothing short of ranting mad! Why, Hugh,
is there a man, woman, or child now living on this earth
who would voluntarily yield up an estate which they
might keep—an estate of two millions of dollars—for—what?—a
point of conscience! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,
ha! Come, answer me!” she exclaimed, throwing herself
into a chair with a strange, unnatural air of audacity.
“Say! is there a man, woman, or child living who would
do this?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes. Any child would do it. There is one man I
know who would do it. There is one woman who will
do it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Why, Dr. Hutton, anyone,
if they were wealthy, might give up a thousand—ten
thousand dollars, for conscience’ sake; but two millions!
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Why, Dr. Hutton!
I am a human being, subject to like passions and foibles
with other people. I rather like wealth, handsome
houses and furniture, and dress and jewels, and servants
and equipages, and traveling, sight-seeing, and change
of scene. And if there were nothing to be given up but
these, how great would be the sacrifice. But then, I have
magnificent plans of extensive philanthropy; glorious
prospects of social distinction. And to renounce these!
How tremendous the renunciation!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah, Nettie! with your usual perfect openness you
have revealed the very death-throes of your expiring
selfishness. For your selfishness—will die! Conscience
will conquer it. The cup of earthly prosperity is brimful,
and at your lips, but you will put it, untasted, away. I
know you will! I have perfect faith in you!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hugh, you kill me! You madden me! Have you no
pity? I believe you think you will make me do it!” she
exclaimed, starting up and pacing the floor rapidly. “I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>do believe you fancy that you will make me give up this
estate by asserting confidently that I will do it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think your true nobility of soul will constrain you
to it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Suddenly she stopped, threw both hands to her breast,
and turned so ghastly pale that Dr. Hutton sprang to
her side, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Garnet, you are ill! Is it possible that this struggle
produces such an effect upon you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>She dropped her hands from her bosom, her color returned,
and, smiling strangely, she said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, Hugh, do you fancy that I am such a spoiled
child as to grow ill because I want to have my own way
in all things? No! But as I hurried up and down the
room in such a heat I was arrested suddenly by a quick,
sharp pang; a deathly pang, that caught away my breath.
It seemed to me as if another movement would have
been fatal; it seemed as if in the very flow of my high
tide of life and audacity the skeleton fingers of death
had closed around my heart and squeezed it. It is gone
now. Nay, now, nonsense, Hugh! Do not look at me
with such a death-warrant in your eyes. If you look at
your patients that way you will frighten them to death!”
she said, laughing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Garnet, sit down. There—give me your wrist. Did
you ever experience this symptom before?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Symptom! Bless you, Dr. Hutton, it is not a symptom.
Dr. Hutton, if you are out of practice and wish to
get your hand in again, I refer you to all the hypochondriacal
old men and women on the plantation, who will
delight your professional heart with ‘symptoms’ for any
length of time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Garnet, you have been too much agitated to-day, for
one of your excitable temperament. Go to rest.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will. I feel, for the first time in my life, a little
exhausted,” she replied, rising and extending her hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>He drew her unresisting to his bosom, pressed a kiss
upon her brow, and led her to the door.</p>

<p class='c010'>He did not see her again until the next day at dinner,
when she appeared in full dress, and looking grandly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>beautiful, joyous, and decided. He congratulated her.
She smiled exultingly, and said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“I feel well, very well, because I have come to a
decision.”</p>

<p class='c010'>When dinner was over she challenged him for a walk
on the terrace around the roof of the house. When they
had reached this elevated site she advanced to the front
of the balustrade, and, stretching one hand out toward
the magnificent prospect, she said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Look, Hugh! Saw you ever a fairer scene?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is indeed a sublime and beautiful prospect.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And has it no more interest than that? Listen,
Hugh! All these waving forests and rolling hills and
plains; all these fields and barns and granaries; all these
orchards, vineyards, and gardens; these terraces, with
their statues, fountains, and conservatories; this mansion
house, with its stately chambers, halls, and saloons—is
ours—is our beautiful, our superb home, if you will
take it—when you take me,” she said, turning to him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nettie, when Satan wished to tempt Christ he took
Him up into a very high mountain, and showed Him the
kingdoms of the earth and the glory thereof, and said:
‘All these will I give Thee, if Thou wilt fall down and
worship me.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Upon my soul, I thank you for the parallel you have
chosen to run between me and Satan!” exclaimed Miss
Seabright, with a burning cheek.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You misconstrue me, dearest Garnet. You do not
tempt me. I am not tempted. It is the Christ in you—the
angel in you—the good in you that is tempted by
Ambition.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hugh! Hugh! It is not for myself now so much as
for you that I am ambitious. With the power this fortune
would give, when joined to your talents, you could
become so distinguished.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Again, Garnet: When Satan tempted Christ it was
not through any puerile idea, but through the grandest
passion of the human soul—the passion by which the
great archangel fell—Ambition. But, I tell you, Garnet,
that if ambition be the most glorious of human passions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>remorse is the most terrible. And, too often one follows
the other as surely as night follows day.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She did not reply, and both remained silent for a few
minutes, when, taking her hand, he said impressively:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do not think me ungrateful, dearest Garnet. Very
deeply do I feel the blessing of your sweet love; very
highly do I estimate the honor of your ambition for me.
But listen, dearest. In erecting your edifice of earthly
happiness, it would be well to lay the basement sure.
You might possess and inhabit a princely palace, luxuriously
furnished, yet you would not glory in its splendor,
or even enjoy a moment’s repose under its roof, if
you knew its foundation to be insecure; that at any instant
in the midst of enjoyment it might suddenly fall
and crush you under its magnificent ruins. Garnet, such
an insecure dwelling-place, such a transient phantasmagoria,
is any plan of earthly happiness not based upon
the principles of justice. Such, Garnet, is your edifice of
enjoyment; for you will feel that death, which hangs
over us all at all times, may at any moment summon you
from its possession to place you at the bar of Eternal
Justice, to answer for the sin of your soul. And your
ill-gotten splendors here will be your condemnation hereafter.
Oh, believe me, dear Garnet, to say nothing of
the sublime beauty of faith displayed in the sacrifice of
earthly interests to heavenly prospects—of temporal
pleasures to eternal joys—there is great good sense in
seeking ‘first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness’;
for, look you; I may gain wealth and renown, but
if my fortune is ill-gotten I cannot fully enjoy it, for
knowing that at any time my soul may be snatched
from its possessions to the bar of God, and, stained with
falsehood and injustice as it is, be hurled thence to perdition.
But, on the other hand, if my fortune is founded
upon righteousness, and built up with the blessing of
God, then I may be as rich and as great as I please, and
yet enjoy this world with a surer joy for knowing that it
leads to a better and an eternal one. Life, dear Garnet,
is a journey to the Judgment Seat. In all your plans,
therefore, of life’s journey, look to its end. If you set
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>out upon a road that you knew was leading you to misery—no
matter how fine the carriage in which you traveled,
how soft the cushions on which you sat, how beautiful
the country through which you passed—you could
not enjoy it; for every mile that should draw you nearer
to its close would increase your uneasiness, for you would
know its end to be misery. Such a journey, dear Garnet,
will be your life if you set out upon it with ill-gotten
riches. Now, look on the other side of the question. If
you should start upon a journey that you know will bring
you finally to a haven of rest and honor—no matter how
common your vehicle, how rough your road, how ordinary
the landscape, how full of unpleasant accidents—you
will endure it, and at every stage with more cheerfulness,
for knowing that it brings you nearer to its end,
and that its end is repose and happiness. And, if your
journey should be pleasant, its very pleasures will be enhanced
by the knowledge that its goal is rest, honor, and
joy. Such a journey will our lives be, dearest love. You
will resign this estate. We will marry, and, feeling the
smile and blessing of God upon us, we will go forth
strongly and hopefully and labor for our living. We
shall have some early struggles, but God will be with
us. He will bless our sacrifice, and we shall finally prosper.
And while weeks are slipping into months, and
months gliding into years, we shall really enjoy the very
making of a fortune, taste prosperity piecemeal, and get
the good of every morsel. Every little comfort that we
may be able to add to our daily domestic life will be
relished the more that we have felt the want of it, and
blessed the more that it has come to us from God. And
for our future years I hope highly, but may not prophesy.
They are in the hands of God,” he said, raising his hat
with profound reverence. Then, his tone changing to
one of deep tenderness, he stretched forth his arms, and
said: “Come, Nettie! Come, my darling wife. You will
give up all this ill-starred wealth, and trust in God to
restore you a hundredfold.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Pale and drooping with excess of feeling she sank
upon his bosom, murmuring:</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>“Oh, God bless you, Hugh! Large and full heart,
God bless you! Where could I find my life but in you?
But, oh, dear Hugh, do not be a martyr at this rational
age of the world! Take my fortune with me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Never, Nettie! Never, so strengthen me Heaven!
When I take you I will take no sin with you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She started, burst from his embrace, and broke forth
with passionate vehemence:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Silence! I will not hear you. I will never give up
my privileges. I will not be a fanatic to please you. Oh!
look at me, Hugh; and do not think I speak from vanity,
but from a war of conflicting passions, that rends my
soul in twain. Do I look like one to be condemned to
poverty, and privation, and domestic toil, and drudgery?
I will speak out, though in your eyes I convict myself
of vanity and presumption. You never called me beautiful
in words, but you have said so with your eyes a
thousand times. Oh, Hugh, I valued my beauty as I
did my wealth, for your sake. But should I be beautiful
in poverty? You know that I know what poverty is!
Look at my hair, Hugh. Yesterday you took the whole
mass up in your hand and looked at it as at a treasure,
so proudly; then you singled out a ringlet and examined
it as a strange beauty, so curiously. Now look at the
ringlets again. Do you think it requires no care to keep
them so soft and glossy, and in such full curl? Why, a
rose-bush will not bloom in full glory unless it is cared
for and tended; neither will my beauty. Hugh, I do not
know why I may not venture to speak before you what
I dare to think before God. I know that my soul’s habitation
is beautiful; and it seems to me fit that it should
be so, and that its beauty should be enhanced by rich
drapery, and preserved from all uses. How could that
be done in bitter poverty?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Garnet,” he answered solemnly, “the soul is greater
than its temple. Would you preserve the temple sacred
from all uses, yet degrade the greater deity within it?
Would you preserve the delicacy of your beauty, and
clothe your form in gorgeous apparel by an action that
would stain your soul with foul dishonesty?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>“Don’t talk to me any more. You will drive me
frantic. Dishonesty! That is the low vice of ignorant
and debased natures, for which they are sometimes sent
to the State’s prison.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And yet which is more excusable ‘in ignorant and
debased natures’ than in intelligent and exalted ones,”
said he sternly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dishonesty! What have I to do with that? This
estate is legally mine. To keep it is not even injustice.
Why do you talk to me so?” she exclaimed, tearing at
her bosom, as she wildly walked up and down the terrace,
as if to pluck away the burning pain there. “Why do
you torture—exasperate—madden me so?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is not I, Garnet. No mere words that I could
speak could disturb your bosom’s peace. It is the awful
conscience there that refuses to be silent,” said Hugh
solemnly.</p>

<p class='c010'>She paused before him, trembling all over; clenching
her chest with her spread hands, as though to clutch the
passion there; her eyes burning in their intense lurid fire,
in fearful contrast with the ghastly paleness of her brow
and cheeks, and gasped between her white lips:</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are an incendiary, sent here to convulse my soul
with war, until Reason herself is hurled from her throne!
Man! man! You know what civil war in a nation is.
Do you know—can you guess what the internal conflict
of a divided soul is? No, you do not. Your well-balanced
mind, like a well-governed State, is always
quiet. But mine! Oh, you have raised an insurrection
in my soul that can never, never be suppressed! Oh,
man! man! it is a grievous wrong that you have done
me. I was so highly happy in my glorious hopes and
prospects until you came. You have killed all my joy.
But do not think,” she exclaimed, with another violent
outburst of passion; “do not think that you have succeeded!
Do not! Never suppose that to please your
fanaticism I will give up my estate—never! never!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, Garnet. Not to please my fanaticism, as you call
it, will you do so, but in obedience to your awakened
and aroused conscience will you do so.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>“What! Never! What! resign all my great plans of
usefulness, of benevolence, of wide philanthropy? Renounce
all my glorious prospects of world honor—perhaps
renown? Man! do you know what you ask of me?
They are worth my soul’s price. Give up my fortune!
Do you know its amount? Why, my income is almost
a queen’s revenue. Do you know, as I do, with what
power it clothes me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know the vast amount and great power of your
wealth, Garnet. And I know the great good that you,
with your wonderful beauty, talent, and enterprise could
do with it; the great distinction you could gain by it. I
know your pride, your ambition, your burning aspiration
after worldly glory, and I feel the stupendous force
of the temptation that is upon you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I tell you, my power, my plans and prospects are
worth almost my soul’s price!” she exclaimed vehemently.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Almost’ not quite. There is a surplus value and
weight about the soul that will weigh down the scale, and
toss the fortune up.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Never, I tell you. Never!” she repeated passionately.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dr. Hutton regarded her fixedly for some moments,
then he asked coldly:</p>

<p class='c010'>“And this, then, is your final decision, Miss Seabright?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; please Heaven, it is.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But it will not please Heaven, Miss Seabright. I
only waited for your decision. I have it, and I shall
leave here to-morrow. Had your conclusion been otherwise—but
no more of that. And now,” said he sternly,
“listen to me! You will go forth into the world. Your
wondrous beauty, genius, and your riches will draw
around you the mighty in intellect, wealth, and position.
Yet, queen of that court as you will be, you will take no
joy on your throne; you will know you have usurped the
seat of another. Your graces of mind and of person will
be the theme of every tongue, yet you will know that
they clothe a soul spotted with dishonesty. Your extensive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>philanthropy will be the admiration of sages and
statesmen, yet their praises will reproach you with the
thought that your munificence is at the expense of another.
Your benevolence will be the sustaining hope and
comfort of all the poor and wretched around you, yet
their very blessings will curse you with the thought that
you have relieved them with means falsely taken and
falsely kept from a widow. You will dwell in lordly
mansions, yet their magnificence will oppress you with
the consciousness that they belong in justice to another.
You will be arrayed in costly garments, yet you will be
scarcely able to bear the glare of their splendor, for you
will know they cover a woman degraded from her pristine
nobility by base ambition, and stained with foul injustice.
You will be adorned with priceless gems, yet
the diamond tiara on your brow will burn and sear your
brain like a diadem of flame; the diamond necklace on
your bosom will scorch and eat into your heart like a
circlet of fire.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hugh! Hugh! spare me! I tell you you will drive
me mad!” she cried, clasping her temples.</p>

<p class='c010'>“At last you will cap the climax of your hopes by
marrying some grand magnate of the land, yet you will
bear within your bosom all the while a false, a widowed,
and a lonely heart, for you will know that your husband
is not your true mate; for you will know—you do know,
oh, Garnet!—you feel by all the instincts of your nature
that it was to this—this bosom that God wedded you
from the first!” he said, dropping his voice to a gentle
tone, and drawing her toward him.</p>

<p class='c010'>She dropped her face upon his shoulder, and wept and
sobbed as if her heart would break. Such convulsions of
sobs; such a deluge of tears! Gasping all the while:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I do! I know it, Hugh. Then, why will you
cast me from you because I happen to be burdened with
a fortune? Is not that a strange, new reason for leaving
the girl that you love?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Garnet! darling Nettie!” said Hugh tenderly; “if
you were suddenly bereft of your enchanting beauty,
my love would be strong enough to bear the change; for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>the heart and soul that I loved most would live for me
unaltered. But smirch not the fairness of your soul, Garnet,
for I will not wed moral deformity.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“This is weakness! This is miserable driveling!” exclaimed
Miss Seabright, starting from her resting-place
upon his bosom, and dashing the tears from her flashing
eyes. “I am no mendicant for your love, sir! No! nor
will I purchase it at too high a price, either!” she added
bitterly, throwing off his deprecating hand, and hurrying
from him into the house.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hugh looked after her in deep thought; then said to
himself:</p>

<p class='c010'>“The flow and ebb of ocean’s tide is nothing to the
waving forth and back of her mind in its present phase.
How strong—how terrible is the death-agony of her ambition!
If the contest were simply between ambition and
love, ambition would triumph in a high, proud nature
like hers; but justice sides with love, and together they
are invincible. I would the battle were over, though.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He did not see her again during the day. She did not
appear even at the supper-table.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have no time to tell you how Garnet Seabright spent
that night, how the battle in her soul was fought and
won. I have only time left for results.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the gray of the morning Hugh Hutton came downstairs,
booted, great-coated, and laden with his saddle-bags,
preparatory to mounting his horse to set forth on
his journey. He found Garnet Seabright in the great
hall, apparently waiting for him. She stood at the foot
of the stairs and leaned for support against the balustrades.
She was looking very haggard, as from loss of
rest and anxiety; yet, through all the physical weariness
there radiated the light of a calm joy. He lifted his hat
and bowed, intending to pass her, when she raised her
hand, and by an adjuring gesture, stayed him, murmuring
very low:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dr. Hutton, was it really your intention to leave me
this morning?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was, Miss Seabright,” he replied, in a deep, constrained
voice.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>“‘It was,’ and is it?” she added, in a low tone, gently
moving from her position.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was, and is, Miss Seabright, unless you give me
the only good reason for staying.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She advanced toward him, slowly, slowly, with averted
face and deeply blushing cheek, laid both her hands in
both of his, and murmured almost timidly:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Stay, then, Dr. Hutton; I give up the estate.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hugh Hutton dropped his saddle-bags, drew her to
his bosom and pressed her there, but spoke no word as
yet.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, take me, Dr. Hutton! I am not worth much,
bereft of all my glory, shorn,” she smiled faintly; “quite
shorn of all my beams; but such as I am, you may have
me, Dr. Hutton,” she murmured, dropping her head on
his shoulder. Then, as he strained her to his bosom, the
passion-fraught heart of the man found expression for its
fullness of emotion in one “great heart-word”:</p>

<p class='c010'>“My wife!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, your wife,” she whispered, very softly, hiding
her glowing face on his bosom. “Your wife! no more
nor less than simply that cheerful toiler by your side. I
thought to have conferred wealth on you! It was a
proud, presuming thought—it is past now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My wife! my wife! you have! you do——” ejaculated
Hugh Hutton, with his full heart gushing in every tone,
until it choked his utterance, and he stopped.</p>

<p class='c010'>Through all their painful struggle he had not broken
down until now; and now—but she was talking again,
murmuring in her sweet, deep tones again, and he bent
to listen, to hear her whisper:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Hugh! such a night as I have passed; such resistance
of the demon, before he would flee from me.
But the war is over now—quite over! The estate, the
projects are all resigned, and not regretted—for, oh,
Hugh! where could I find such richness and fullness of
life and joy as——” Her low voice died away with her
breath along his cheek and chestnut hair. But it was
Garnet’s nature or her present mood to pour forth the
fullness of her heart in words. She spoke again: “Oh,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>Hugh, I am so glad, so comforted and strengthened, so
proud of you, that you did not yield one jot or tittle of the
right, even for my love. Oh, Hugh! oh, Hugh! my
guide and guard! be always good, and great, and strong,
that I may have full life and joy in loving you. And
when you have drawn your Nettie up to your own high
moral level, soar you higher still, that, though rising
herself, she may see you ever above her, and honor you
as now! as now!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, God, have I deserved this!” exclaimed Hugh
Hutton, raising his eyes in grateful adoration an instant,
and then bending them with unutterable love on Garnet,
as he ejaculated in earnest, fervent, broken language:
“Nettie! Nettie! not Heaven, not Heaven could give me
a higher incentive to high resolve than He has given me
in your faith—in your faith!”</p>

<p class='c010'>He pressed his lips to hers, and from that first burning
kiss the tide of eloquence found way. He snatched her
up in his arms, hurried into the parlor, set her in a chair,
sank down by her side, and, folding his arms adoringly
around her form, poured forth, in words of fire, the long-pent,
great passion of his heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was Saturday night, and Dr. Hardcastle had not
yet returned home to supper. The family, except Elsie,
had all retired to bed. Elsie had had a very fatiguing
day, as most industrious housekeepers must have in
bringing the week’s work to a conclusion. Elsie’s work,
however, was not yet fully completed, though the family
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>clock was on the stroke of nine, for having gotten
through with all the heavy household labor, cleared up
the supper-table, put the children to bed, and persuaded
her mother to retire to rest, she set the coffee pot and
a covered plate and dish to keep hot for Magnus, replenished
the fire, drew a little table up before it, and sat
down with a large basket of stockings to darn—a couple
of dozen of little hose and half a dozen pair of large ones—all
to be looked over, and half to be mended. And
Elsie, with her usually happy alchemy of turning everything
into a subject of congratulation, said to herself
that it was very fortunate she had so many stockings to
darn, as it made the time pass so much quicker while
waiting for Magnus. Yet Elsie was very weary; very
well prepared to appreciate the blessings of the Sabbath
that makes cessation from work a positive duty. Yes,
she was very weary, though the only signs of fatigue she
showed were in the deeper flush of her cheek, the brighter
light of her eyes, and the clammy moisture of her fair
forehead that half uncurled the golden ringlets. The
last little stocking was drawn upon her hand, and the
bright needle swiftly gliding in and out among the
meshes of the last rent, when the quick gallop of a horse
into the yard apprised her that her husband had come,
and in an instant more the door was thrown open and
Dr. Hardcastle entered. Elsie was about to rise and receive
him, when something strange and novel in his air
and manner arrested her attention, as he said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, do not stir! Sit still, dear Elsie! I want to look
at you just as you are a moment.” He threw off his
great-coat, drew a chair to her side, seated himself by
her, and gazed at her for the space of half a minute.
Then he took her hand into his palm, pressed it, and,
opening his hand, watched the rosy tide ebb and flow
through her still beautiful fingers. “Elsie,” said he,
“how long have we been married, dear wife?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Eleven years and more,” replied she, looking up inquiringly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you remember, dear, Judge Wylie’s ball given in
honor of your return from school? Do you remember
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>that we had just heard of my changed prospects, and
that we knew if we should marry we would have to go
forth to a life of toil and self-denial—and do you remember
that I took this hand into mine with fear and
trembling for its destiny as it lay in my broad, brown
palm, a tiny snow-white thing, sparkling with diamonds
like icicles on snow, a fairy hand—an ideal hand?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I remember you talked a great deal of poetry
about my hand, dear Magnus—and I remember that seeing
you loved its beauty so much, I made a rash promise
to keep it always beautiful for your sake. I could not do
it, dear Magnus. It is not so fair and elegant now as it
was then,” said Elsie, smiling, and holding it up.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But, oh! how much dearer! how much more beloved!
Then it was an ideal hand—now it is a human hand, a
mother’s hand,” he said, taking it again and pressing it
to his lips and bosom, and gazing fondly on her. Then,
after a little, he spoke again, saying: “Elsie, dearest,
there was another promise which you made, but in my
name, and which I tacitly indorsed, yet have failed to
perform.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, dear Magnus?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you remember the dress you wore upon the memorable
occasion of that ball? I do perfectly. I do not
know the material of which it was made, but it floated
around you as you moved—a soft and radiant mist. And
when I spoke of it, bemoaning the fate that would
change it for a plain garb such as befitted a poor young
doctor’s wife—you smiled hopefully, and promised that
in ten years, when I should have ‘achieved greatness,’
you would wear a much richer dress, which should still
befit my station—and I indorsed the promise; yet ten
years have passed, and I have failed to redeem it. My
Elsie still wears coarse clothing, and works from morning
till night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your Elsie is happy, dearest Magnus. And the
Princess Charlotte herself, the idol lady of all England,
could not say any more. Young people, especially where
youth is brightened by such sanguine blood as mine, have
too many extravagant hopes—make too many rash
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>promises; I say again, your Elsie is happy, dear Magnus,
and if she had the world she could not say more.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He gazed on her in fond admiration for a little while,
and then said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Elsie, dearest, there is one thing at least in which we
did not promise or expect too much—in which we have
not failed to keep our promise—to love each other more
and more every year we should live.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She raised her eyes to his, and he read her answer in
their loving glance.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, Elsie,” he said, at last, “you are happy; yet it
is not now the hope of better days to come that makes
you happy—for more than ten years have passed, and I
have not laid by a thousand dollars. So you can scarcely
expect now that I shall ever make a fortune by my
profession.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, we make a comfortable living, and shall continue
to do so; and as for our dear children, we must
educate them to work, as we have done. Let me give
you your supper now, Magnus.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No—not just yet,” he said, smiling on her hand and
pressing it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, then, let go my hand a minute, till I finish
darning little Elsie’s stocking.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No! no more work to-night, Elsie,” he said firmly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh! just let me finish this last stocking; it completes
the whole job.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No! no more work to-night! No more work ever
more for you. The long, long trial you have borne so
patiently, so nobly, is over. Elsie! dearest Elsie! fortune
has come to us at last.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Elsie stared at her husband with a look so blank that
you could not have told whether she had heard good or
bad news—an instant, and then a sudden joy broke over
her countenance, and she exclaimed, in a voice of wonder
and gladness:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Fortune! You tell me so, Magnus, and it must be
true.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, fortune—yet it has come to us through such
solemn, not to say tragic, circumstances that our prosperity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>must be received with a chastened spirit. Listen,
dearest Elsie—this evening, as I returned home, I called
at the post office and found a letter from Reynolds, who
used to do all my Uncle Hardcastle’s law business. By
his letter I learned that about five weeks since my unhappy
cousin, Lionel, who had just returned from making
the tour of Europe with his ward, was instantly killed
on Hutton’s Island by the accidental discharge of a pistol.
My uncle never recovered from the shock of his death,
and he sank gradually until about five days since, when
he died, leaving me sole heir to all his property and
executor of his will.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Alas! Magnus, is it not a sad and grave thought, that
no property which we do not make by our own toil ever
comes to us except through the death or the misfortunes
of others! Alas! Magnus, our prosperity should indeed
be received with a very chastened spirit.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sudden riches should be always received with
fear and trembling; and when they come by sudden death—with
awe!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Elsie looked down thoughtfully upon her clasped
hands and then, after a little while, inquired:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, Magnus! what will be your first movement under
these new circumstances?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall proceed at once to Hemlock Hollow to settle
up affairs, and prepare the old hall for the reception of
you and the children. And by the time those arrangements
are completed the weather will be sufficiently
settled to remove them. The only point of difficulty is in
the temporary disposition of my professional business.
I scarcely know what to do with my patients. I wish
Hugh would return and take charge of the practice for
a few weeks during my absence, or until the people could
get another physician to settle among them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is quite time that we had heard from Hugh. But,
dear Magnus, has this sudden news quite deprived you
of your appetite?” said Elsie, rising and putting away
her basket of work.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No—oh, no, dearest! Give me my supper.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Elsie’s nimble hands quickly laid the cloth, and spread
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>the little supper. Magnus drew up his chair, and Elsie
had just poured out his coffee when the quick gallop of
a horse up to the house, followed by a loud knocking at
the door, arrested their attention. Magnus went to answer
the summons, and in another instant Hugh Hutton
entered. “Why, Hugh!” exclaimed Dr. Hardcastle and
his wife in one breath.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come in! Come in! We are so glad to see you!
But where on earth did you come from? How did you
come? You did not come by the stage this afternoon,
for I was at the stage office myself when it came in,” said
Dr. Hardcastle.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No; I missed the coach at the last station, and had
to hire a horse to bring me hither. But how do you all
do?” said Hugh, shaking hands with both.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, very well! But you, Hugh, how is it with
you?” asked Dr. Hardcastle, glancing at his black suit.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I may reply in your own words—‘Well, very well!’
You got my letter?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, friends, it was a bitter blow to me, but I believe
now it was dealt in mercy to her. You have heard
from Hemlock Hollow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes—but only this evening.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And what do you intend to do?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To go on there immediately and prepare for the removal
of my family as soon as the weather permits. But,
come, Hugh—come, here is supper. See, Elsie has already
set your plate and knife and fork and poured out
your coffee.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What! have you really not supped yet?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have not! Draw up.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The conversation at supper turned upon the affairs
of Hemlock Hollow, Point Pleasant, Huttontown, and its
neighborhood. Yet there was a studious avoidance of
the subject of Mount Calm and Garnet Seabright, until
the cloth was removed, and Dr. Hardcastle arose with
the evident intention of showing his guest to his
chamber.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then Hugh made a sign to his host to take his seat,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>and resumed his own, saying: “Well, my dear friends,
you have inquired after everybody in our old neighborhood
except my fair young hostess, Miss Seabright of
Mount Calm; and yet one would think that she would
interest you more than all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hugh paused for a reply, and looked at them both.
Elsie’s brow crimsoned, and she turned away. Dr.
Hardcastle looked very grave, and remained silent.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you knew Miss Seabright personally you would
admire her very much. She is the most superbly beautiful
woman I ever saw—of the brunette order, I mean,”
he added, bowing and smiling toward Mrs. Hardcastle,
who averted her face with a heightened color. “Yes,
she is certainly the most splendidly beautiful brunette I
ever saw—and with a soul, too, more beautiful than its
shrine.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Still Elsie averted her head, and Dr. Hardcastle continued
gravely silent.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You do not answer me,” said Hugh perseveringly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hugh, my dear boy, Elsie and myself love and admire
you sufficiently. Do not insist upon our loving and
admiring your friend, Miss Seabright. Under all the circumstances
it is quite too great a task for human
nature.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yet,” said Hugh—and his voice faltered, and the
tears swam in his eyes—“yet last week I was the instrument
in the hands of Providence in setting a far greater
task than that to human nature, sir! And not to nature,
well-disciplined human nature like yours, but to young,
ardent, impetuous human nature—and I saw, through
tears and groans, and writhings of the spirit, that task
accomplished. What should you think of a young girl
endowed with great wealth, peerless beauty, graces and
accomplishments—fitted in every way to adorn the highest
circles of society—a girl, besides, of high self-appreciation—of
great ambition—of adventurous enterprise—whose
head and heart were busy with a hundred grand
and glorious plans of life—what, I ask you, should you
think of such a girl, in such circumstances, giving up
her wealth, her rank, her splendid plans and prospects,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>her soul’s most cherished expectations and desires for the
sake of simple, abstract justice?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should think that such a noble girl was worthy of
a king’s worship, or rather of a hero’s love. But it is
impossible! No girl would ever do this,” said Dr. Hardcastle,
turning and gazing at Hugh with wonder.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will you please to look over these documents,” said
Hugh, drawing a packet of papers from his great-coat
pocket and laying them on the table.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The title deeds of Mount Calm, and legally conveyed
to Alice Chester Garnet by Garnet Seabright!” exclaimed
Dr. Hardcastle, examining them. Then he laid
the documents down, squared himself round, placed his
hands upon his knees, and, staring full into the face of
Hugh, said: “Hugh! what the d——, I never swore in
my life! Don’t make me begin now! But what the
deuce does all this mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You see what it means. Miss Seabright, having
come of age, and feeling that she has no just right to
the Mount Calm estate, conveys it to its original owner,
Mrs. Garnet!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Elsie suddenly clasped her hands, and bent forward
with flushed cheeks and open lips.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dr. Hardcastle continued his fixed, broad stare, until
Hugh exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c010'>“God bless all our souls, Magnus Hardcastle, you are
not the only noble specimen of God’s workmanship on
earth. There are others capable of magnanimity besides
Magnus—even the young girl, Garnet Seabright!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Garnet! She is a diamond of the first water. Is it
possible that this should be so? I can scarcely credit
the testimony of my eyes and ears! That Miss Seabright,
as soon as she reached her majority, should have
given up her estate. Oh! it must have been a mere impulse
of youthful enthusiasm. She could not have known
the value of money and property—and, besides, you must
have used great powers of persuasion with her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No—you are wrong in every point. It was not enthusiasm.
All her enthusiasm was enlisted on the other
side, in favor of social distinction, for which she considered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>wealth indispensable. Nor was she ignorant of the
value of money. No, enlightened by experiences in the
extremes of, first poverty and afterward wealth, this girl
of twenty-one had as accurate a knowledge of the value
of money and property as any miser, beggar, or banker
of forty-two. Nor was it without a struggle she resigned
the estate. Most terrible indeed was the battle in her
soul before Justice subdued Ambition. Nor was it
through my persuasion that she made this glorious sacrifice
to right. No; no mere words of mine could have
subdued that towering pride, governed that aspiring
ambition. No; I simply set the truth before her, and then
let it work its way. No; I set the truth before her, and
then I might have gone to Patagonia or Bering Strait,
and the result would have been the same. She would
never have known an hour’s peace until she had restored
the property, at whatever sacrifice to her pride
and ambition.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Here Elsie broke forth, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh! what a noble girl! Oh! I love and admire her
so much. I do think if I were in mother’s place now I
should be Quixotic enough to convey the whole estate
back again to her. At least, I know I would make her
take back half of it. My heart burns toward that noble
girl, and I feel half ashamed that we should benefit by
her magnanimity. I feel as if by her giving and our
receiving so much that she is more noble than we are.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, yes! She is indeed a noble, a wonderful girl!”
exclaimed Dr. Hardcastle.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And this noble, this wonderful girl,” said Hugh, with
his cheeks and eyes kindling with pride and joy—“this
glorious girl is going to be my wife! Congratulate me,
dear friends!” he suddenly exclaimed, impulsively thrusting
out a hand to each.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Going to be your wife? I am so glad,” exclaimed
Elsie, pressing his left hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Going to be your wife? Why, then, dear Hugh, this
great sacrifice is fully as much yours as hers—since what
was hers would have been yours,” said Dr. Hardcastle,
shaking his right hand.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>“Never mind that; only wish me joy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We do! We do! with all our hearts,” said Elsie,
clasping his hand again. “But when are you going to be
married, Hugh?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Next Thursday four weeks. Having deprived Nettie
of all her wealth I must take her as soon as possible
under my legal protection, unsettled as I am, and trust
God with the result. Yes, next Thursday four weeks;
that will give you time to prepare to come to Mount
Calm, which, having been just handsomely fitted up for
the reception of Miss Seabright, on her return from
Europe, is in a proper condition to receive your family.
Miss Seabright will remain at Mount Calm until our
marriage, which will take place there. We wish you to
arrive at or before our wedding day, that when we leave
the mansion house we may leave you in possession.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hugh, we are not, of course, authorized to promise
anything in the name of Mrs. Garnet, who is at this moment
ignorant of Miss Seabright’s magnanimity; but—I
would she were here to answer for herself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Here the clock struck twelve, and Dr. Hardcastle,
lighting another candle, said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Friends, it is Sunday morning. Let us waive the
discussion of worldly matters for to-day. Hugh, you
know your chamber. Good-night!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XLI.<br> <span class='large'>THE SECRET REVEALED.</span></h2>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And in her lineaments they trace</div>

      <div class='line in30'><i>—Byron.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>In the meantime Miss Seabright was preparing to resign
her state. Few can estimate the terrible trial it
was to this just but ambitious girl to abdicate her elevated
social position and step down upon the common
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>level to labor with the common herd. You have already
seen how, in the fearful struggle which had ensued—in
that dread bosom tempest—all the latent selfishness
which marred that noble nature was thrown up and
exposed upon the crest of the tossing waves of passion.
But if, in this soul-storm, her hidden evil was cast up to
view, it was also cast off. And then, when the waves of
her heart subsided, and the clouds on her brain dispersed,
and the sun of right shone out clear and bright,
illuminating her soul, and revealing her to herself—then
she saw that there was something in her own nature
greater than all her adventitious surroundings. Now she
would not have said to Hugh what she had said before,
“I am not much, shorn of my beams.” No, indeed, there
was consolidating in her heart a noble, steadfast self-appreciation
that would no more falsify itself by factitious
humility than degrade itself by unjust action. And
having once made the sacrifice, and turned her back
upon the splendors of her past fortune, there was no regret,
no looking back, like Lot’s wife; her face was set to
her forward path—her strong, impetuous soul already
rushing on to realize her future of loving and hopeful
toil with Hugh for her companion and guide. With
Hugh! How, the recurring of his very name, the tide
of emotion, like the rushing of a mighty river, would roll
over her, overwhelming and confusing her soul with a
sort of lost, delirious joy! Within this month of sacrifice,
how much stronger and more concentrated had become
her love for Hugh! And if the Judge of all hearts
had demanded a reason for the mighty love that was in
her, she would have been constrained to answer, “It is
his moral integrity that has mastered my heart. It is
his moral integrity that would not waver, for love or for
ambition—those two mightiest passions of the human
soul. I loved him before, I loved him well enough to
have given him myself and all my wealth, but when I
found in him a moral rectitude that would not bend for
love of me, or hope of grandeur, I was drawn up to adore
him. Yes, that is why I would rather follow him barefoot
over all the earth, if necessary, and serve him as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>Indian woman serves her lord, than be myself the object
of worship to all the world.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Yes, there was a man to love through life and unto
death; there was a man to repose upon in all weakness,
to confide in in all emergencies; whom the combined
power of love and ambition, beauty, wealth, and the
usages of society that would have justified him, could
never move from his uprightness. There was a pillar of
strength to cling to in a storm. It was with as much
high-born pride and joy as love that Garnet thought of
her betrothed.</p>

<p class='c010'>The month and her preparations drew near their close.
She was daily expecting to hear of the arrival of the
family of Dr. Hardcastle at Hemlock Hollow. Dr. Hutton,
who had not yet returned, was to come with them.
She was looking for them by every stage, and hourly
she added some new attraction to the preparations she
was making to receive them. The ancients were accustomed
to adorn a sacrifice before offering it up, and the
same instinct impelled Miss Seabright daily to walk
through her halls and chambers, designing, with her artistic
taste, new improvements and embellishments for
the palace home she was about to resign.</p>

<p class='c010'>The wedding day arrived. It was a bright and beautiful
day in May. Upon the evening previous Dr. Hardcastle,
with his family, had arrived at Hemlock Hollow.
Therefore, there had been no time or opportunity for a
meeting between them and Miss Seabright previous to
the marriage day. Dr. Hutton was a guest at the Hollow,
and a note from him to Miss Seabright informed her
that they would all be at Mount Calm at an early hour of
the morning. Owing to the rather recent deaths in the
family, and the peculiarity of the circumstances, it had
been arranged that the marriage ceremony should be performed
quietly at eight o’clock in the morning in the
saloon of Mount Calm, in the presence of few witnesses,
and that immediately after the ceremony and breakfast
the young couple should depart to seek their Western
home, leaving Mrs. Garnet in possession of the mansion
house and the estate. The only guests invited were the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>Hardcastles, with Mrs. Garnet, Judge Wylie and Miss
Wylie, and their old friend, the Rev. Mr. Wilson, with
his wife and young sister. The marriage ceremony was
to be performed after the Episcopal ritual by the recently
installed pastor of the New Church.</p>

<p class='c010'>At seven o’clock in the morning, therefore, the few
privileged friends, with the exception of the Hardcastles,
who had not yet arrived, were assembled in the saloon
of Mount Calm, awaiting the entree of the bridal party.</p>

<p class='c010'>At last the carriage containing the family from Hemlock
Hollow drove up and paused before the main entrance
of the mansion, and Dr. Hardcastle alighted, followed
by Dr. Hutton, who then handed out Mrs. Garnet
and Mrs. Hardcastle. They passed up the marble stairs
and into the hall, where they paused until Mrs. Garnet
had sent up a servant to the bride, to request the favor
of being received by her before she should come down
into the saloon, and obtained an answer that Miss Seabright
would be pleased to see Mrs. Garnet and Mrs.
Hardcastle in her own apartment.</p>

<p class='c010'>The servant who brought back the message bowed
and offered to show the ladies up. Mrs. Garnet and her
daughter followed him up the broad staircase into the
upper hall, and through a door into an elegant front
dressing room, which Alice recognized with a smile as
having been her own bedchamber.</p>

<p class='c010'>The room, when they entered, was vacant of other
occupants, but they had scarcely seated themselves at the
front windows when the opposite folding doors opened
and Miss Seabright appeared before them.</p>

<p class='c010'>A novice, when she is about to renounce forever the
pomps and vanities of the world and take the black veil
of the nun, arrays herself for the last time in costly
apparel. So Miss Seabright, when about to resign forever
all pretensions to splendor, arrayed her glorious
form with almost regal magnificence. Her bridal costume
was a rich Mechlin lace over white and silver brocaded
satin, and festooned with bouquets of pearls and
diamonds, a fine and ample lace veil confined above her
and ringlets by a wreath of the same priceless gems.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>Mrs. Garnet raised her eyes to look upon the bride.
She had never seen Miss Seabright before, and now, at
the first sight of her magnificently beautiful form and
face, Alice started violently: all the blood suddenly left
her cheeks for an instant, and then rushed back again,
crimsoning her face to the very edges of her hair—so
startling, so strong, so painful was the resemblance of
Miss Seabright to the late General Garnet. Yes, there
was the same majesty and sweetness of mien, the same
regal turn of head and neck, the same fiery, dark hair,
the same smoldering and flashing eyes, the same beautiful
lips, the same bewildering smile. The only difference
was that in place of the latent diabolism under General
Garnet’s countenance all heaven shone from Miss Seabright’s.
Alice felt that she looked upon her late husband’s
face, only with its beauty idealized, elevated, made
divine. The vague, half-formed suspicions concerning
the paternity of Garnet Seabright that had occasionally
floated through her mind now became painfully confirmed.
As she gazed chills and heats alternately shook
her frame, and then a strong, yearning compassion
mingled with the high admiration she had hitherto felt
for the noble-souled girl, and she said to herself: “I
wonder if she knows it?” Then, looking at her more
attentively, she exclaimed inwardly: “No, no! she does
not know or suspect it! My soul upon it, she does not
know or suspect it! No; there is a high self-appreciation,
a grandeur in her mien and air, a majesty seated
on that pure and lofty brow, unconscious of shame—unconscious
of the very possibility of shame! God shield
her from the knowledge! for, oh! as I look upon her
noble presence now, I feel too surely that the knowledge
of her shame would kill her with a stroke swift, sharp,
and sure! God shield her from the knowledge! It were
sacrilege to discrown that imperial brow of its diadem
of unsullied honor, and brand it with shame instead.
God shield the innocent from the knowledge of guilt
which is infamy! God shield her! Oh, I can now forgive
my dead husband for having cheated me out of this
beautiful daughter, when I think he had the grace to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>keep her innocent of the knowledge of her parentage and
his guilt. Yet how he must have loved her! Oh, doubtless
many times when his brow was overcast with gloom
and sullenness, it was with the thought of this child.
He never confided his sins or his troubles to me. Would
he had! I could have been as much of a friend as a wife
to him. Would he had had faith enough in me, when
the poor little one was orphaned, to have laid her on my
bosom instead of exiling her to that bleak isle! I would
have brought her up as my own. Did he dream that I
would have been otherwise than good to a little child?
But he would not trust me. He could tyrannize over
me in a thousand useless ways, yet never could venture
to bring the motherless child to my arms. No; he could
never tell me until that night, when drunken both with
brandy and bad passions—he taunted me with the fact.”</p>

<p class='c010'>All these thoughts of Garnet’s parentage passed with
the rapidity of lightning through the mind of Mrs. Garnet,
while Miss Seabright, with outstretched hands and
radiant countenance, was advancing toward her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No; she must never know it! That pure, bright
brow must never be smirched and darkened by the burning,
blackening smite of shame! Yet shall she be another
daughter to me,” concluded Alice, as she arose to
meet the bride. As Miss Seabright, being the taller of
the two, bent to welcome Mrs. Garnet, Alice threw one
arm caressingly over her shoulder, and saying:</p>

<p class='c010'>“We must not meet as strangers, my love,” kissed her
cheek.</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Seabright looked down with proud gravity upon
the gentle lady for an instant, and then said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have great pleasure in welcoming you back to your
native halls, Mrs. Garnet. Long may you live in the enjoyment
of them!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The enjoyment of which I owe to you, noble girl.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nay, madam; the long deprivation of which you
owed to me, unfortunately. The repossession of which
now you owe to nobody—nothing. It is simple justice.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But it is not justice, thou noble girl, that thou, who
wast brought up in affluence——”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>“Nay, madam—I have known penury, too!” interrupted
Miss Seabright, with a sort of proud humility, if
the phrase be admissible.</p>

<p class='c010'>Without noticing the interruption Mrs. Garnet resumed:</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is not justice that one educated in luxury, and in
the prospect of nearly boundless wealth, should be suddenly
bereft of everything and reduced to a position for
which she is totally unfit.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, madam! pardon me. Had I not an example before
me? Did not your own admirable daughter resign
wealth and station and go forth to a life of toil and
privation to preserve intact the integrity of her heart?”
said Garnet Seabright, with gentle dignity, waving her
hand toward Mrs. Hardcastle, who had withdrawn to
a distant window during this colloquy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, to preserve the dignity of her heart, and the
love of her heart—which latter gave her strength to do
as she did. Yes, and that was scarcely a trial to Elsie,
who possessed a cheerful, loving, and active temperament,
and was, besides, without your aspiring ambition.
No, Miss Seabright—nature, even more than education,
has quite unfitted you for the life of active household
toil and privation, voluntarily assumed for long years
by Mrs. Hardcastle. No, Miss Seabright—justice, as
well as your own magnanimous conduct, has imposed
this duty on me.” Miss Garnet paused and, drawing
from her pocket a roll of parchment, placed it in the
hands of the bride.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is this?” asked Miss Seabright.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is a deed of conveyance of property to the amount
of one-tenth the Mount Calm estate. Receive it, with
my love, as a marriage portion.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I cannot, madam,” said Miss Seabright, returning the
deed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nay, take it—take it then as a mark of the high esteem—the
honor I bear you!” persisted Mrs. Garnet,
tendering the packet.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I cannot take it, madam.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Receive it, then, as your right, proud girl! Education
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>and expectation have given you a right to this
Take it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Indeed, believe me, I cannot, madam; though from
my soul I thank you,” said Miss Seabright, with emotion.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Garnet looked discouraged for an instant, and
then, as her glance fell upon the bright and joyous form
of Elsie, as she stood looking out from the front window
upon the spring scene, her eyes lighted up, and she called
to her:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Elsie, my love, come here. You have a gift of persuasion
that I, with all my good-will, never possessed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Elsie came smiling forward.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Miss Seabright, this is my daughter, Mrs. Hardcastle.”
(Ah, Heaven! if they knew they were sisters!)</p>

<p class='c010'>As Miss Seabright bowed Mrs. Hardcastle threw her
arm around her neck, and kissed her heartily, exclaiming
simply:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I wished to meet you so much! I shall be so
glad to know you well!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I called you here, my love, to aid me in persuading
Miss Seabright to suffer me to do her justice. You
know——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I know!” said Elsie, interposing her cheerful
voice. “I know all about it. See here, Miss Seabright!
I never was crowned with magnanimity, sublimity, enthusiasm,
or the rest of the Godlike virtues and frenzies!
But I am gifted with some sound, good sense, which is
ever at the service of my friends, and I offer you a sample
of it now. Magnanimity is Godlike, until it is distorted
into fanaticism, when it is fool-like! It was magnanimous
in you to give up the whole of this estate. It
would be fanatical to refuse to take the tenth of it when
it is offered to you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The aptness of this argument seemed to strike Miss
Seabright, for, smiling, she replied:</p>

<p class='c010'>“I refer you to Dr. Hutton. I underwent such a
course of lessons from him upon the love of lucre, as opposed
to the love of justice, that I shall not forget it
soon. Ha! I am not sure that, should I go to the altar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>with a deed of any portion of this estate in my pocket,
he would not think I had backslidden in principles, and
reject me even there!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Here Miss Joe, who, unperceived, had entered the
room and came up to them, interposed her voice, saying:</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wish he wouldn’t—I just do! I shouldn’t like to
see Hugh make such a fool of himself as that!” Then,
patting Miss Seabright affectionately upon the shoulder,
she whispered, in a knowing, confidential tone: “You
take it yourself, honey. Who has got a better right to
some o’ General Garnet’s property than you? Sure,
you’re his own flesh and blood! and the image of him,
too! You’re his own flesh and blood, honey. I know
all about it. It’s all in the little yellow hair trunk among
the letters. You take it, honey. You’re his own flesh
and blood!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh! Miss Joe, your rash words have destroyed—have
blasted her!” exclaimed Alice, in a voice of agony,
as the old lady, having fired this magazine, hurried out
of the room quite heedless, because quite unsuspicious
of the impending ruin.</p>

<p class='c010'>And ruined indeed looked Miss Seabright, with every
vestige of color blasted from her marble-like face. Still
as a statue of despair, she stood with her dilated eyes
immovably fixed upon the receding figure of the old
woman, until it had disappeared from the room.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then tossing back her bridal veil and springing forward
she grasped the hand of Mrs. Garnet, and, darting
her wild gaze piercingly into the lady’s gentle eyes, she
asked hurriedly:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did I—did I hear aright? What did she say?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nothing; do not mind her, Miss Seabright,” replied
the lady, with a flushed brow.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What did she say?” repeated Garnet.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nothing! Nothing worth telling, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh! I implore you, tell me what did she say?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My dearest girl! nothing that it is well you should
hear.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nay, then! I adjure you to tell me! By your soul’s
truth, I adjure you to tell me!” she persisted wildly.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>“She told you, dearest Garnet, that you were the
daughter of my late husband; but——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Stay! am I so?” interrupted Garnet, in a voice of indescribable
anguish.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes—I believe so,” replied Alice gently.</p>

<p class='c010'>She dropped the hand she had grasped with such
strength, and stood as if suddenly turned to stone, for
an instant—and then springing forward with the wild
energy of desperation, she exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Unsay those words—or see me die before you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Alice suddenly threw her arms around the form of the
stricken girl, and, catching her wild eyes, gazed into
them deeply and tenderly as though she would have
transfused all her own sweet love and resignation into
that rampant soul, and said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dearest child! She told you only what we knew, and
still loved you. Dearest child! you are my husband’s
daughter, and Elsie’s younger sister—and we love you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The child of your husband and not your child! The
younger sister of your daughter, and you living!” exclaimed
the wretched girl, sinking, withering, shriveling
as it were before the fell blast of this burning and consuming
revelation. At last she groaned forth in tones of
unutterable sorrow: “Oh! oh! was it right, Heaven! was
it well, Heaven! just as I had made a great sacrifice to
duty, and achieved a great moral victory; was it well to
strike me in my pride of place, and bring me down so
low! so low!” Then with another spasmodic outbreak
of energy, she exclaimed: “Unsay those words! Unsay
them, or see me die before you! Take all I have—wealth,
rank, prospects, hopes! all, all! but, for the love of God,
unsay those words! Take all, all! but leave me my honorable
name! Take all, all! but let me go an honored,
if an humble bride, to my husband’s home! Oh, for the
pity of God!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Again Mrs. Garnet threw her arms around the cowering
form of the wretched girl, as though she would envelop,
sustain, save her in this trying moment, by the
might of love; and saying:</p>

<p class='c010'>“My dearest Garnet! my love! my love! you shall go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>an honorable and an honored bride to your husband’s
home. One whom I will take to my bosom thus—is
a worthy match for any man. You should have been my
own daughter, Garnet, but that I was cheated out of you;
but I claim you now. You are my husband’s child, and
the express image of his person; therefore you should
have been my child; therefore I claim you now to be my
child of right! I loved your father, Garnet! I love you!
Believe me! Do not cover your face, and turn it from
me. Let me kiss you. Do not grieve so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Grieve!” exclaimed the sinking girl, in a voice of
anguish; “I do not grieve, lady! I die! Grieve! Oh,
look you, madam! If I had suffered the loss of friends
by death, or what is worse, by treachery; if I were
miserably poor, ill, and abandoned; if I were dying of
disease, want, and neglect; if I were misjudged, slandered,
and persecuted; if I were unjustly charged, falsely
imprisoned, and innocently doomed to death; if I were
suffering any other anguish of mind, or agony of body,
then I might grieve—but now! now! that I know myself
a living, breathing monument of guilt!” A terrible
shudder shook her frame and arrested her speech—her
form collapsed and sank more than before—and it was
in a dying voice she resumed: “Now that I know myself
infected by worse than leprosy”—she paused and
looked at herself from head to foot; she stretched forth
her beautiful brown arm, frosted with pearls and diamonds,
and surveyed it; she gathered up the lurid ringlets
of her dark hair and gazed on them; then, dropping
her arms wearily, she continued—“I was not so vain
as grateful for my beauty. But now! oh, God! to think
that every atom of flesh, and every drop of blood, and
every nerve and vein to my heart’s core is pervaded, permeated
with sin and reproach! sin and reproach! Oh,
God! oh, God, quickly take back the soul Thou didst
send into this shape of sin!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Once more her form cowered, crushed beneath the
overwhelming weight of ignominy. She tottered and
must have fallen to the floor, but that Elsie sprang and
aided her mother in supporting her to a sofa near.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>“I declare,” exclaimed Elsie, in her positive manner,
“there should have been no concealment; she should
have grown up with the knowledge of her parentage!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh-h-h! doubtless,” murmured the nearly dying girl,
“oh, doubtless they should have told me of my birth!
And then my soul would have grown up familiarized
with infamy, until it became as base as its proscribed
dwelling-place!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But,” said Elsie, in her calm way, “is it possible you
never suspected this? Is it possible that, when you came
home from school, with all your faculties alive and keen,
you could have looked upon my father’s portrait, and
looked upon your own reflection in the glass, and not be
struck by the resemblance, the identity of the two faces?
Is it possible that you did not suspect?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Suspect this! suspect my birth! suspect my shame!
Oh, woman, woman! you found me proud and joyous!
how could I have suspected this? You found me living!
how could I have suspected this and lived?” she exclaimed,
in a voice of indescribable grief and reproach,
and then her form subsided, as it were, prostrate, among
the cushions. And so it was throughout the scene; frequent
convulsive outbreaks of anguish would be instantly
followed by the prostration of all strength. And
then she lay with her hands pressed upon her face a long
time perfectly still, but for an occasional start and shudder.
She lay there, with Elsie sitting by her side, until
the clock struck eight—the marriage hour. Mrs. Garnet
then approached, and, kneeling by her, embraced and
kissed her, saying:</p>

<p class='c010'>“My dear girl, my daughter, rouse yourself. The bitter
trial of this needless revelation has shocked you
nearly to death. But it will pass away, as all trials must,
my love. Garnet, I, too, have had trials in my time,
heart-crushing disappointments and sorrows, from which
I thought I never could recover. But I have recovered,
you see. My sorrows are gone, long ago; gone down
the stream of the past, and I have been happy for years.
So it will be with you. We all think our first sorrow
is to kill us, but it does not. We live and recover.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>So you will find it. This sudden revelation has overwhelmed
you, but you will get over it. We will make
you forget it. You will be an honorable and honored
wife. You will be loved and happy. Come, rouse yourself!
Your marriage hour has struck. Your husband
waits you even now; come! Give me your hand!
Garnet!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My marriage hour has struck! My husband waits
me now! Oh, madam, do you then believe me base in
soul as in birth?” exclaimed the miserable girl, with
bitterness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the name of Heaven, what mean you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you think that I, stripped of all other possessions,
will carry my dower of shame to my husband’s home?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the name of mercy, what do you mean?” asked
Alice, in alarm.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, merely this, that this marriage must not and shall
not proceed! Oh, no! Dr. Hutton must never blush
for his wife’s parentage!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Garnet glanced at Elsie in despair. Elsie here
interposed her blooming face and hopeful voice, saying:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Miss Seabright, as I told you before, I have no
grand sentiments, but I have some good sense, and it
seems to me, as it takes two to make an engagement, it
takes two to break it, honestly; I think, as you have
plighted your troth to Hugh Hutton, you might consult
him before breaking faith with him, for such a cause, at
the very last moment.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Consult him!” said the poor girl, as the blood crimsoned
her ashen brow. “How can I consult him? And
if I could, I know his self-immolating generosity. I
know, besides, that he loves me so, he would hold me
to my word; he loves me so, he would take the shame
with me. Consult him! No, no! for many reasons. But
without consulting him, I will break with him; since in
breaking faith I shall wrong him less than in keeping
it!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah, Miss Seabright, that is sophistry! And sophistry
is ingenious, but it deceives no one. Duty is very simple,
and it never can be mistaken. But I hear the bridegroom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>and his friends approaching the door. Come, rise! let
me re-arrange your hair and wreath.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Garnet opened the door, and admitted Dr. Hardcastle
and Hugh Hutton. Dr. Hardcastle went up to his
wife, who drew him off to a distant window, while Hugh
Hutton, seeing his bride reclining, pale and disordered,
upon the sofa, hastened to her, stooped over, took her
hand, and gazed anxiously upon her, inquiring:</p>

<p class='c010'>“My dearest Garnet, what is the matter? Are you ill
again?”</p>

<p class='c010'>She turned her face, whitened and sharpened with anguish,
upon him, gazed intently in his countenance, but
said nothing for a full minute—then, as by a new and
sudden impulse, she exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hugh! I know my birth. Do you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Dr. Hutton dropped her hand, frowned, and compressed
his lips.</p>

<p class='c010'>Garnet’s features convulsed with a spasm of anguish,
and she covered her face with her hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>When Hugh Hutton saw that he dropped upon his
knees at her side, removed her hands, and kissed her
pallid brow, saying:</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know that God created you a beautiful and high-souled
woman. I know that by no act of your life have
you ever marred His creation. I seek to know”—he
broke forth with sudden energy—“I consent to know no
more.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hugh,” she said, looking at him piteously, “an evil
covered up is not an evil cured. Hugh, this marriage
must not go on.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nettie, you are insane!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, never more soberly, sadly sane than now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What! would you break your engagement to me—and
at the last moment?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; for a sufficient reason.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I will not consent to it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not ask your consent. I break it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nettie!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hugh! stoop down here! nearer—there. Hugh!”
she said tenderly, running her pale fingers through the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>dark waves of hair each side his massive forehead, and
holding his head between her hands as she gazed fondly
in his face—“Hugh! I know you love me. I have never
doubted it one single moment. And I do love you. So
much—so much, Hugh, I love you so much that, to save
my own immortal soul I would not marry you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You dare not refuse me. I claim your plighted
faith. I claim you for my wife,” exclaimed Hugh Hutton
passionately.</p>

<p class='c010'>“To save you I dare refuse you. To save you I dare
break my plighted faith, and take the sin upon my own
soul. Hugh! dear Hugh! in one great contest I yielded
to you, because high principle was on your side. But
this is a different matter; I am as inexorable as Death.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nettie! Nettie! I am strong; but your loss would
paralyze me. But oh! it cannot be. I will never, never
leave you nor forsake you. If I do, may God abandon
my own soul!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Her features were convulsed again, and for a moment
she concealed them with her hands; then laying her
hands tenderly upon the head of her kneeling companion,
she said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“It does not matter much for me, for I think that death
is upon me—but for you, Hugh—oh, it is hard, it is
hard for you. It is hard for you, so good and true, so
noble as you are, to be so grievously wronged by disappointment.
Oh! it shakes one’s faith in goodness, in
Heaven. But I love you so—I love you so that I will
pray God, living or dying, I will pray God to give you
another love, another wife, who shall be worthy of you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“By Heaven! I will have no other wife but you. And
you will I have!” exclaimed Hugh Hutton, forgetting
the presence of others, and speaking so loud as to startle
Mrs. Garnet, who came forward and said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Hugh! my dear friend, is not this a trouble?
What shall we do to persuade her?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dear friend, leave me alone with her for a little
while. God has deputed to me some power over His
self-willed child—this noble but stubborn girl. Leave
me with her.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>Mrs. Garnet turned to go, but was met near the door
by Miss Joe, who bustled in, and, nudging the lady’s
elbow, whispered to her, saying:</p>

<p class='c010'>“I say! aint it time for them all to walk down? The
parson—Parson Sinclair—has been come for half an
hour, and the company downstairs is getting out o’ patience.
Besides, if the ceremony don’t make haste and
get performed, the breakfast will get spoiled—the coffee
will boil all its strength away, and the batter for the rice
waffles will rise so much it will turn sour. What are they
all waiting for?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nothing. And I do not know that there will be any
marriage,” replied Mrs. Garnet sternly and bitterly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hugh, what is the matter?” exclaimed Miss Joe,
looking around in surprise. Then, perceiving the recumbent
form of Miss Seabright, with Dr. Hutton still
kneeling by her, she inquired: “Dear me! What ails
Garnet?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have ruined her peace forever,” indignantly exclaimed
Mrs. Garnet, unable to forbear reproaches.
“You have killed her with your uncalled-for revelations.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Me! ruined what? killed which?” exclaimed the innocent
old lady, in perplexity.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Garnet Seabright. I say you have killed her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Killed her! why I haint even tetched her. I haint
done a thing to her; I haint harmed a hair of her head.
I haint been a-nigh her. She was well enough when I
come through here with the napkins.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Words kill! You told her the secret of her birth.
You told her she was General Garnet’s child, and the
shock and the shame have overwhelmed, have killed her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The old lady listened with her eyes starting out of her
head, and her mouth wide open with unmeasured astonishment,
and then exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Me! Me tell her she was General Garnet’s child!
Why, I didn’t do no such thing! Who says I did?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I! I heard you with my own ears.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, you didn’t hear any such a thing! High! how
could I tell such a lie as that, when it wa’n’t the truth?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Garnet, in her turn, stared with such unbounded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>astonishment and incredulity, that the old lady took high
offense, and exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well! upon my word! Next time it lightens, I
shouldn’t wonder if you accused me of setting the clouds
afire. Come! if you don’t b’lieve me, there’s the young
gal herself. Go ask her now. She aint dying neither,
no more ’an I am. She looks gashly as a corpse, to be
sure, but Lord! I’ve seen her look that way afore, when
she’d get into her tantrums long o’ her guardian or
Hugh. Come! I’ll go;” and the old lady waddled precipitately
across the room to the sofa, exclaiming wrathfully,
“Miss Seabright! Garnet Seabright, I say! Now,
did ever I tell you such a falsity as that you were General
Garnet’s child?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Dr. Hutton started up from his kneeling posture, and
stood staring at the excited old lady. Garnet sprang up
from the cushions, and gazed at her face with all her
soul in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My goodness, child; don’t stare at me so wild!
You’ll give me the fever ‘n’ ague. Answer my question.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Here Dr. and Mrs. Hardcastle were attracted to the
scene of action.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Can’t you speak? Did ever I say you were General
Garnet’s child?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did—you—not—say—so?” asked Miss Seabright,
with life and death struggling in her bosom.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No! I did not say so. How could I tell such a lie,
when it wasn’t the truth?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And—he—was—not—my—father?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wish people wouldn’t be slandering of your poor,
dear mother! poor, little, wild thing. She was distantly
connected with myself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But,” said Elsie, interposing, “no one raised a doubt
but yourself, Miss Joe, and we would like to hear you
explain your words, that gave rise to all this trouble.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Words! what words?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The words you whispered to Miss Seabright when
you passed through the room an hour ago.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh! yes. Why, I telled her she might well have a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>share o’ the property, seein’ how she was General Garnet’s
granddaughter.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“General Garnet’s granddaughter!” exclaimed everyone.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes. Don’t all talk to me at the same time, you
’fuse my head. I declare, if my heart aint as big as a
batch of light dough, and my head goes round like a
coffee-mill! That ’minds me of the breakfast—’deed it
will get spoiled.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But you did not tell her that she was General Garnet’s
granddaughter. It was something else you told
her,” said Elsie.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I—don’t ’fuse my mind. I don’t ’member what the
words were, but that’s what the meaning was.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I remember what the words were exactly,” said Elsie;
“she said she was ‘his own flesh and blood.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To be sure I did; that’s just what I did say. It’s all
in the little yellow hair trunk—her mother’s little yellow
hair trunk. I never knowed anything about it until I
come here to live, because I never had no chance to fool
my time away ransacking of old papers afore. If you’ll
all stop talking to me, I’ll tell you all about it, and you
can read the rest. You see, General Garnet, when he was
a boy about seventeen or eighteen years old, he falls in
love long of a poor gal, and marries her secretly. In
about a year arter this, the poor gal she died, leaving of
a young infant son. Then General Garnet—he was Mr.
Garnet then—he being a wild young man, and not wanting
to be bothered with children, he puts this child out to
nurse, and goes off and forgets all about it. But the
boy, as he grew up, he knew, somehow, who his father
was, and sort o’ always had a hankering arter finding
him. Well, he didn’t meet his father till he listed in the
wars, when he was no more than fourteen years of age;
and he served under him the whole length of the war;
and though General Garnet—he was Captain Garnet
then—being a handsome, dashing, gay young officer,
would not acknowledge or even notice this son, yet the
boy seemed to worship the very earth his father walked
on. He seemed to live but for one thing in the world—to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>love and serve his handsome but unnatural father.
He watched over the safety of his life and his honor.
Twice he saved his father’s honor at the loss of his own
reputation; and that was the reason why he never got
to be anything better ’an a corporal all the time he
sarved in the war. I’ll tell you all about it some time,
or else you can read it all in the old letters in the little
yellow hair trunk. Well, and at last he saved his
father’s life, at the expense of a dreadful wound, that,
arter years of illness, caused his death. Well, this boy—though
his father didn’t set any store to him, and his
comrades didn’t vally him as they ought to ’a done—was
thought a heap on by my wild little cousin. And so,
when he come from the wars, wounded, and feeble, and
broken-hearted, she stole away to him, and they were
married. She said she could work for both, and she did
work for both till he died. Well, arter the poor misfortunate
young man was dead and gone, I suppose General
Garnet’s conscience, as had been stone dead long
before, had a resurrection, or else the ghost of his murdered
conscience haunted him, for he paid a visit to the
young widow, and found her grieving herself to death.
Well, he made a whole parcel o’ splendid promises as he
never fulfilled. And when the poor young thing died,
leaving her little darter in his care, he jest passed her
over to me as a great favor, and that was the very last
I ever saw or heard of him or his promises till he quarreled
long o’ his own darter, and then he comed over and
’dopted Nettie. You see, God never could prevail with
him to do anything, but the devil could make him do as
he pleased.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There, there, Miss Joe, that will do,” interrupted Mrs.
Garnet, to whom these severe reflections were deeply
painful. “Never, Miss Joe, cast unnecessary reproach
upon the memory of the dumb, defenseless dead.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I won’t. I am sure if the Lord pardons him, we can.
I won’t say any more. Only if you want to know all
the particulars, you see, you can read the letters in the
little yellow hair trunk. And that’s the end of the story;
and now I know the coffee is spoiled.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>“Garnet, you have a right to blush for your parentage—but
let it be a blush of enthusiasm, for never
have I heard of two such disinterested souls,” said Dr.
Hardcastle, shaking her hand with cordial sympathy.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hugh Hutton said nothing as yet, but stood by her,
pouring all his earnest, loving soul through the gaze he
fixed upon her face. And she—down her cheeks the
tears had poured like rain. But now that copious and
refreshing shower was over and the sun of gladness
shone out again, Garnet smiled brightly, while yet the
tears sparkled like rain-drops on her ringlets. Mrs.
Hardcastle, with her cheerful blooming expression, was
standing behind her quietly rearranging the disordered
wreath and veil. Mrs. Garnet went to the door of the
adjoining room, and beckoned the two young ladies who
were to act as bridesmaids. Dr. Hardcastle opened the
hall door and admitted the groomsmen, who entered and
gave their arms to the young bridesmaids. Hugh Hutton
took the hand of Garnet, and, when she arose, Elsie
arranged the folds of her robe, and whispered:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Never mind if you are very pale and agitated, dear;
it is not so unbefitting a bride—besides, your veil is
down, you know.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The bridal party moved onward downstairs. As Dr.
Hardcastle followed with his wife, he turned to her with
an arch look, and whispered:</p>

<p class='c010'>“My dear Elsie, there is an old acquaintance of yours
below stairs.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Many of them, I suspect.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, but this one is an uninvited, unexpected, but
most welcome guest.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Whom?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Honorable Ulysses Roebuck!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘The Honorable Ulysses Roebuck!’ I remember
‘Marse Useless,’ as the negroes used to call him; but
how on earth became he ‘Honorable’?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Dr. Hardcastle shrugged his shoulders, elevated his
eyebrows with a queer smile, and answered:</p>

<p class='c010'>“I really suppose just as more of our Honorables become
so. He failed at everything useful, went to a distant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>part of the State, took to politics, made stump-speeches
‘full of sound and fury, signifying nothing’ and
got himself sent to Congress. After an absence of ten
years he has just now revisited his native neighborhood.
He reached Point Pleasant by the early boat this morning,
and, finding that the family were all here, he followed
them, and is here also.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And his old ladylove, who jilted him to marry my
father, and lost both, and who must be now near twenty-eight
years of age—how did she receive him? I should
like to have seen that meeting!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I saw it. When he first entered the saloon he was
caught in the arms of Judge Jacky, who ran to him and
rapturously embraced him, overwhelming him with welcomes.
Then, when released from the old gentleman’s
arms, he shook hands with all his friends and acquaintances,
looking uneasily around the room all the while, as
if in search of someone else. At last his flying glances
alighted on the distant form of Ambrosia, standing near
the fireplace. He made her a formal bow, which she
acknowledged by a cold courtesy!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“After a lover’s quarrel and a separation of ten years!
That is a first-rate sign, Magnus; I should not wonder if
he had cherished her image in his heart through all those
years.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, they had not even spoken when I came away.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Better and better! I shall not be surprised if he
propose for her before the day is over.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They had now reached the saloon where the bridal
party were already ranging themselves before the clergyman,
who was no other than our oldest friend, the Rev.
Milton Sinclair.</p>

<p class='c010'>“See!” whispered Dr. Hardcastle, pointing to where
Miss Wylie sat gloomily at one end of the room, and
Mr. Roebuck morosely at the other; “see! I do not believe
they have spoken yet.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I believe they’ll be married in a week!” laughed
Elsie.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the clergyman had opened his book, the ceremony
was about to commence, and all became silent and profoundly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>attentive while it progressed. It was over, and
friends crowded around to offer their congratulations to
the newly-married pair. In the crowd Ulysses Roebuck,
Mrs. Hardcastle, and Ambrosia Wylie got pressed together.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I declare!” exclaimed Elsie, with her cheerful, ringing
tones, “if here are not two of my old, old playmates!”
And seizing a hand of each, she shook them
heartily; then joining those two hands in hers, she said,
“Let me be the mediator. Be friends, as you long to
be!” and slipped away, leaving them together.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Shall we be friends? Shall we be more to each
other, Ambrosia?” said Ulysses, pressing her hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; if you can forgive the infidelity caused by ambition,
and expiated by whole years of suffering!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have waited for you ten years, Ambrosia. I should
think that an answer. Come! let’s go to the bay window
and talk over old times!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not now; the company are going in to breakfast,”
replied Ambrosia, taking his arm; and they followed in
the wake of the foremost. Mrs. Garnet approached the
clergyman, who still lingered as if lost in abstraction.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Sinclair,” she said, “it gives me great happiness
to see you back here and settled in our parish. I am
much pleased, also, to welcome you to our house. The
company have gone in to breakfast; will you come?”
Mr. Sinclair bowed in grave silence, gave the lady his
arm, and they followed the others.</p>

<p class='c010'>Breakfast was over. The traveling carriage of Mount
Calm was packed and at the door to convey the newly-married
couple to the stage office at Huttontown, whence
they were to start for the West. The family party, consisting
of Mrs. Garnet, Dr. and Mrs. Hardcastle, and
the bride and groom, were grouped for a last leave-taking
in the passage, when Miss Joe suddenly appeared
among them, in her poke bonnet and brown shawl, with
a bandbox in one hand and a basket in the other, and
followed by a negro man, bending under the weight of a
great trunk. When the little party stared with surprise,
she exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>“Well, now, you needn’t look so queer, all of you,
cause I couldn’t help of it! I’ve been a-struggling and
a-struggling with my feelings, and I couldn’t help of it!
I’m gwine long o’ Hugh and Nettie. They’re like my
own children, ’cause I took care of them when they were
little! And I’m gwine long o’ them. Besides, long as
they’re poor, they’ll want somebody to help them work.
It aint much I can do now, seeing I’m nigh on to seventy
years old. But, leastways, I can mend their clothes,
and darn the children’s stockings, and mind the baby,
and so on.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was no time for much argument now; but to all
that Mrs. Garnet and the Hardcastles could say to prevail
on her to remain at Mount Calm the old lady turned
a deaf ear. She was set to go with Hugh and Nettie,
because they were like her own children, and because
they were poor.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But they are not poor,” said Mrs. Garnet; “and, oh!
that reminds me—I have the deed of gift yet,” continued
the lady, producing the deed from her pocket, and placing
it in the hands of Dr. Hutton.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is this, madam?” he asked, examining the
parchment.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is merely a dower with your bride,” said the lady.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is a deed of conveyance, Hugh, investing me with
properties to the amount of one-tenth the great Mount
Calm estate. Can I take it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, dearest—no, you cannot!” replied Dr. Hutton,
pressing her hand; then, turning to the lady, he said:
“Mrs. Garnet, we sincerely thank you. This generosity
is so like yourself that we are not surprised at it, while
we must gratefully decline it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>As no arguments could move Hugh Hutton from his
resolution, the effort was at last abandoned.</p>

<p class='c010'>The carriage, into which Miss Joe was packed, drew
up nearer to the door. Garnet embraced her friends successively.
Hugh Hutton shook hands with them in turn,
and handed his bride into the carriage. The steps were
put up, the door closed, and the carriage rolled away.</p>

<hr class='c011'>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>Mrs. Garnet continued to reside at Mount Calm, happy
in her vocation of “Lady Bountiful” to the neighborhood—happy,
that is to say, as long as the fine weather
of spring, summer, and autumn last, during which, in her
missions of usefulness or benevolence, she could walk,
ride, or drive through the most beautiful country in the
world; but, when winter came, with its wind and rain,
and hail and snowstorms, its impassable roads, and its
long spells of tempestuous or intensely cold weather, and
its longer seasons of enforced confinement within-doors,
the lonely lady of Mount Calm found the solitary
grandeur of her mansion house dreary enough. The
minister had been her coadjutor, and often her companion,
in her labors of beneficence, during the preceding
eight or ten months; and now, in the stormy winter
weather, he was her willing representative and almoner
among the sick, the poor, and the suffering. No fury of
tempest overhead, or depth of snow, or quagmire under
foot, could interrupt the weekly visits of the pastor to the
lady. The solitary lady knew this; and so, even in the
most frightful weather, during the darkest, dreariest, and
loneliest seasons, there was one day in the week to which
she could look forward with certainty of enjoyment—namely,
to Wednesday, when, let the wind and the rain,
the hail and the snow, do what it might to prevent him,
the minister was sure to present himself at Mount Calm.
Each Wednesday evening it became more painful for
these two friends to part, and the parting was protracted
to a later hour. One very stormy night in February,
when he had lingered by her fireside later than ever before,
and had at last risen to take leave, he detained
her hand in his a long time in silence, and then faltered:
“Alice, are we never to be more to each other than
now?” The lady shook her head in mournful negation,
and there was a “soul’s tragedy” in the tone wherewith
she answered simply: “We are old, now!” The timid
proposition was not renewed then; the shyness of age,
worse than the shyness of youth, silenced the lips of the
minister. The proposal probably never would have been
renewed, but for the intervention of the cordial-hearted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>Elsie—that happy, healthful, sworn foe to all morbid
scruples and needless suffering. She had been made acquainted
with her mother’s early history, and for years
past she had watched over the delicate lady with more
care and tenderness than over any of her own robust and
blooming babies. Now that she was divided from her,
she felt increased solicitude for the welfare of the fragile,
sensitive recluse. It was toward the spring that she was
awakened to a knowledge of the attachment existing
between the lady and the pastor; and, after taking observation
for a few days, she one day said to her mother:
“Mother, why don’t you marry the minister?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dear Elsie, what could suggest such an absurd thing
to your mind? What would the neighbors say? At our
age, too!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dearest mother, they may wonder a little; but, upon
the whole, they will be well pleased. Besides, shall their
wonder prevent you being comfortable? You need each
other’s society—you and the minister. You are both so
lonely—you in your mansion, he in his lodgings; you
need each other. Come! accept him, mother. Magnus
and I will give you our blessing,” laughed Elsie; and
then, immediately regretting her involuntary levity, she
said seriously: “Dear mother, think of this. You have
reached the summit-point of life; before you lies the
descent into the vale of years; your old friend stands on
the same ground, with the same road before him. Give
your hand to your dear old friend, and go ye down the
vale together.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Elsie was successful in her efforts. Before another
winter the lady and the minister were married; and
thenceforward the serene and beautiful life of the pair
gave a poetic fitness to the name of their homestead,
“Mount Calm.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Dr. and Mrs. Hardcastle made Hemlock Hollow their
place of permanent residence. They erected an elegant
mansion, and improved and adorned the grounds with
such artistic taste that it was considered one of the most
beautiful seats in old St. Mary’s.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Honorable Ulysses and Mrs. Roebuck spent their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>summers at Point Pleasant, and their winters in the
metropolis, until the Honorable Ulysses grew weary of
political life and careless of popularity, and lost his election,
when they took up their permanent abode at the
Point, with Judge Jacky Wylie.</p>

<p class='c010'>And the families of Hemlock Hollow, Mount Calm,
and Point Pleasant formed an intimate social circle, and
kept up their agreeable relations after the St. Mary’s
fashion of family dinner-parties, social tea-drinkings, fish
feasts upon the coast, fox-hunts among the gentlemen,
neighborhood dances, etc.; while the gentle, but powerful
influence emanating from Mount Calm spread the
spirit of religion over all.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dr. and Mrs. Hutton eventually settled in a Southern
State. Miss Joe Cotter remained with them to the end
of her long life. Consistent in her economy to the very
last, she devoted the remaining years of her life to “laying
up treasures in heaven.” Dr. Hutton became one
of the most celebrated physicians in the country, and
amassed a large fortune. Mrs. Hutton became one of
the brightest stars in the great Southern constellation of
beauty, genius, and fashion. Their home is a beautiful
edifice on the banks of a Southern lake, within easy distance
of the city. For elegance, taste, and luxury it is
scarcely excelled by the far-famed palaces of the Old
World. From his present affluent ease Dr. Hutton delights
to look back upon his early struggles, and he repeats
now, with more emphasis than before, that, “A
young American should never permit himself to depend
upon the accidents of fortune for success in life; for in
our prosperous country a man of good health and good
habits need never fail to make an independence for himself
and family, and to win the blessing of God.”</p>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
